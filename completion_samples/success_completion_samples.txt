<think> The goal is to create an equation using the numbers 19, 98, and 18 to equal 97. Let's start exploring possibilities with the operations available. I'll first consider if I can use subtraction or addition to adjust the total that results from the given numbers.</think>
Considering the numbers and the target, starting with addition seems plausible. My initial thought is to subtract a number from one of the larger numbers (98 or 19) and then add the other number to the result.
<think> If I start by trying to subtract a number from 98, a reasonable candidate would be to subtract 18 and use 19 with 98 - 18, which equals 80. But we need 97, so let's try another approach.
Instead of subtracting 18 from 98, let's attempt to adjust the result by subtracting 19 from 98, then add 18. This should give us closer to the desired result.
Let's check if 98 - 19 + 18 equals 97.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 19) + 18 </answer>
<think> 98 - 19 = 79, and 79 + 18 equals 97.
So the equation we're left to verify is 79 + 18, which indeed equals 97.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 19) + 18 </answer>
This final equation correctly equals 97 using the numbers 19, 98, and 18 exactly once, following the given constraints.

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers - they are 13, 65, 28, and 43. The target operation to reach 37 is a subtraction. Given that 65 and 43 have a difference close to 22, we might be able to use the numbers 13 and 28 to reach 37. Using subtraction between 65 and 43 gives us 22. To reach 37 from 22, we need an addition of 15. Now, we need to use 13 and 28 to form a 15. Adding these gives 41 which is too much. Subtracting 28 from 13 gives -15 which is negative. The number 13 alone doesn't help as well because we need a positive 15. Thus, to form 15, considering all numbers we can form by combining 13 and 28 in our basic arithmetic operations, 13 + 28 = 41, 28 - 13 = 15 (this is what we need), and 13 + 28 gives us 41 which is too high, and 28 - 13 gives us 15, which is perfect. Therefore, we have successfully combined 13 and 28 to equal 15 and 65 - 43 = 22. Thus, the equation would be 22 + 15 = 37.</think>
<answer> (28 - 13) + (65 - 43) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider what numbers we can create with the given numbers and operations to get a result of 56.
Considering we can use each number only once and using only the given numbers and operations, +, -, *, /, it's worth trying the multiplication and then performing the necessary operation.
Let's see what happens if we first multiply 6 by 19:
6 * 19 = 114
Now, we need a number that when divided by 58 or subtracted from it can result in 56 or 56 + 58 = 114.
Since 114 - 58 = 56, this seems like a viable solution. </think>
<answer> 6 * 19 - 58 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll consider if multiplication or division can help me reach 37. Since the numbers available are 13, 17, and 33, dividing might not be ideal as the resulting number after division would likely not be evenly divisible to reach 37. So, let's focus on addition and subtraction first. I notice that 33 + 17 = 50, which is close to 37 but still a bit too high. If I subtract a number from 50, I may get 37. Let's try subtraction and see what 50 minus something results in 37. 50 - 13 = 37. That fits exactly! So, 50 equals 33 + 17, and 37 equals 50 - 13.</think>
<answer>(33 + 17) - 13</answer>

==============
<think> To achieve the result of 79 using the numbers 96, 30, and 13, we need to use the operations available. Since using 96 in most positions would result in a much higher number than 79, we should consider subtracting or dividing it.
One possible way to start is by subtracting 30 from 96 and then adding 13, as the initial subtraction might bring us closer to 79. Let's calculate this step by step:
1. Calculate 96 - 30 = 66
2. Add 13 to 66: 66 + 13 = 79
Therefore, the equation is 96 - 30 + 13 = 79.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 30 + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 23, 65, and 51 to come up with an equation that equals 93 using basic operations. 
Since none of the three numbers individually equals or can easily reach 93 by using basic operations, I'll first consider the possibility of combining them. 

If I focus on the subtraction operation, 65 - 23 equals 42. That's close to 93, so I'll use this difference to reach the target. Now I need to reach 51 from somewhere, and adding these two numbers increases the sum to 106, overshooting the target.
Next, I consider if I can use multiplication or division to make adjustments. Multiplication seems like it would make the numbers too large quickly, and division without a small number would likely not affect the sum much. 

Using the subtraction of 42, I can now use the remaining number 51. Now, 93 - 42 = 51. This works perfectly, with 51 remaining from the subtraction. 
</think>

<answer> 65 - 23 + 51 </answer>

==============
<think>Since we can only use each number once and we need an equation equal to 76, I'll first examine the numbers and see if I can combine them in a way to get closer to 76. The number 76 is just 10 more than 66. 66 is the sum of 36 and 30. The number 30 is close to 62, but not quite there. However, if I used 36 divided by 2, it becomes 18, which is 30 - 12. Therefore, 36 / 2 + 62 = 30 + 18 = 48, which is still 28 short of 76. Adding 36 means we've gone over. </think>
Given the above thoughts, let's reevaluate the options.
<think>Considering our current numbers and operations, let's try a different approach. If we subtract 36 from 62, we get 26. If we add 26 to 50, we get 76. So, 62 - 36 + 50 = 76, which checks out. </think>
Based on this thought process, the final equation is:
<answer>62 - 36 + 50 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I notice that 33 and 2 are relatively small numbers. When considering the target number, 58, it seems adding or subtracting these two numbers won't get us very close to 58. However, multiplying or dividing them might help in getting closer to the desired result. 
If I multiply 33 by 2, I get 66, which is not useful since it overshoots our target 58. 
Now considering division, 33 divided by 2 is 16.5, which is also not leaving us closer to 58. 
Since multiplication or division with 2 and 33 don't seem to get us the answer, I should explore using the number 89. 
If I add 89 to 2 or 33, it would greatly surpass our target of 58. Therefore, my best option is to subtract. 
Now, if I subtract, 58 - 89 gives a negative number, so the only option to achieve the difference is adding, which, as mentioned before, has not been successful.
It seems this straightforward method won't work. However, I can try a different approach. If I first try to simplify the problem, I can divide 89 by 2, which gives 44.5, and then subtracting 33 from it results in 11.5, but this is not 58 either.
Instead, I notice that 89 - 33 = 56, which is now only 2 away from 58. Now, since 2 is the last number that's not used, adding it to 56 does result in 58. </think>
<answer> (89 - 33) + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> Since we need to reach 69 with the numbers 81, 67, and 79, and each number can only be used once, it's best to start by examining which operation could make sense with these numbers. Subtracting or adding these direct values (81-67, 81+67, etc.) doesn't provide us with 69. Multiplication and division won't work effectively due to the large magnitude of 81 at one end and 79 at the other. I see an opportunity to use the fact that we have a multiple of ten (81) and a number close to it (79). </think>
<think> Perhaps combining the numbers in a different way could help. Consider 81 - 79 which equals 2, and then maybe apply another operation to this result in combination with 67. Using the remaining 67 to get to 69 might be tricky but could be achieved through addition or subtraction. Consider 2 * 34 = 68, which is close to 69 and can be adjusted by addition. Therefore, 67 + 2 = 69 might work.</think>
<think> Putting the pieces together: First, using the difference between 81 and 79 which by trailing rules equals 2, and then applying this result with 67 through an addition to get 69. 81 - 79 = 2, then 2 + 67 = 69.</think>
<answer>(81 - 79) + 67</answer>

==============
<think>First, let's consider the target number we need to reach, 79, and the numbers we are working with: 51, 54, 76. Since 76 is quite large, it would be difficult to reach 79 using most operations directly. However, subtracting smaller numbers to get closer to 79 may be feasible.</think>
To reach 79:
1. 79 - 76 = 3
2. We need to get from 3 to 79 using the remaining numbers 51 and 54.
3. Adding 51 to 3 gives 54, but we actually need 71 more (since 76 + 5 = 71).
4. Multiplying 51 by 5 gives 255, which is much too large.
5. Adding 54 to 3 gives 57, which is 22 less than what we need (79 - 57 = 22).
6. So, let's think about the inverse operations. Multiplying 79 by 2 eventually leads us to 158, which is 2 * 79, but we need to account for the 3 we subtracted.
7. We know 51 * 5 = 255, and we're 22 away from 79. So, instead of adding 54 to 3, try adding 22 to 255.
8. We know 255 + 22 = 277, which is far from 79. So, a simpler operation, like subtracting 22 from 277, would be 277 - 22 which equals 255 - 22 + 3 = 253.
9. Instead, we should directly methodically check:
   - 54 - 51 = 3
   - 54 + (76 - 51) = 54 + 25 = 79
We found the equation!</think>
<answer> 54 + (76 - 51) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 89, 33, and 32 using basic arithmetic operations to get 90. Let's start with the numbers I have and consider what's feasible with each number:
- 89 is quite close to 90 and could be subtracted with a smaller number to reach 90.
- 32 can be subtracted.
- 33 could be added.
My strategy will be to subtract a smaller number from 89, then try adding 33 and/or subtracting 32 to see where we come up to 90. </think>
<answer> (89 - 32) + 33 </answer>
Using the numbers 89, 33, and 32:
1. First, I subtract 32 from 89: 89 - 32 = 57.
2. Then I add 33 to 57: 57 + 33 = 90.
So, the equation that equals 90 using the numbers provided and each used only once is: <answer>(89 - 32) + 33</answer>.

==============
<think> Given the numbers 66, 41, and 29, I can immediately see that 66 is the largest and can be paired with the other numbers in such a way that the remaining operations lead to 78. 
Using the 66, if I subtract 29, I get 37, which is close to 78. Now, I need another number to add to 37 to reach 78. I can use 41. However, 41 minus 29 gives me 12 which doesn't help my current goal.
Another strategy is to work on combining 66 and 29 first as 66-29=37 and then use 41 to achieve 78.
From here, if I add 41 to 37, I get 78, which is what we need.</think>
<answer> (66 - 29) + 41 </answer>

==============
<think> I have the numbers 16, 2, and 56. I need to use these numbers in a single equation that evaluates to 20, using basic arithmetic operations. Let's start by looking at what we can do with 56. It's a large number, and I can't easily get to 20 by multiplying or dividing by 2 or 16, so I'll try to use 2 in some way.
</think>
<answer>
(56 - 16) / 2
</answer>
Let's break it down:
- First, calculate 56 - 16, which equals 40.
- Next, divide 40 by 2, which gives us 20.
So the equation <answer>(56 - 16) / 2</answer> equals 20.

==============
<think> I start by thinking which two numbers can be combined first to get close to 79. The difference between 79 and 64 is 15, which makes sense to target as a result of an operation since it can be further adjusted by adding or subtracting the last number. The operations that could potentially produce 15 are addition and subtraction. 
I also notice that 32 is the smallest number, so if it's involved in the first operation, the result is going to be significantly less than 79. That suggests we might manipulate the larger numbers (64 and 47) first.
Now, looking at the two remaining numbers, 47 and 64, the difference of 17 seems plausible for an operation. Adding the number 32 to this would need to be done backwards, hence subtraction.
Let's see how this works: </think>
<answer> 64 - 32 + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the use of each number in the sequence to create an equation. We need to reach 81 using numbers 90, 7, and 2. I'll focus on multiplication as it has the potential to grow the numbers quickly, and subtraction may help with reaching the target number. Given that 81 is close to 90, a difference of 9 to 81 could be achieved through subtraction. So, let's see if I can form the equation by combining 90 and 7 and possibly scratching off 2 or making use of 2 to reach 81. </think>

Now, let's derive the equation.
<answer> (90 - 7) - 2 </answer>
<think> Let's verify:
1. Start with 90 - 7 = 83
2. From 83, subtract 2: 83 - 2 = 81
This check shows that indeed the equation (90 - 7) - 2 equals 81. </think>
<answer> (90 - 7) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think>First, I'll consider the possibility of using addition and subtraction. The target number is 67, and the numbers we have are 92, 46, and 21. If I use these numbers as they are in subtraction, I'll get:
92 - 46 - 21 = 25
This is much lower than 67. If I add something to this result to reach 67, I'll need to add 42, which isn't available directly from the numbers. Now, if I consider multiplication or division, I can possibly use the 21 or 46 in the equation.
Let's try another approach:
92 - 21 does not give the number I need.
Trying to manipulate the 46 directly, I can consider:
92 - 21 - 46 = -15, still far from 67.
Trying another approach, I realize that I might use 46 in combination with 21:
(92 - 46) + 21 = 67
This seems promising. Let me check the math:
92 - 46 = 46, then adding 21 to that.
46 + 21 = 67.
Thus, the equation I need is (92 - 46) + 21, which equals 67.</think>
<answer>(92 - 46) + 21</answer>

==============
<think> 
The goal is to create an equation using the numbers 51, 86, and 85 that results in 50 and utilizes each number only once. I'll try to manipulate the numbers with basic arithmetic operations. 
One key observation is that dividing a larger number by a smaller one could help approach the target. We should examine whether 86 and 85 can be manipulated to use a remainder of 81 (since 51-81= -30 and -30/85 and -30/86 would be outside the range of possibilities using 51).
86 - 85 = 1. 
1 + 51 = 52. 
52 - 85 = -33, which isn't the answer we need. 
Now let's consider the possibility of multiplication or division involving 51. If we divide 51 by 1.5, we get 34, which is still not 50.
51 * 1. 5 = 76. 5, which is far from our aim. 
Another observation is that maybe we could add or subtract some manipulation of the first two numbers to get closer to 50. 
85 - 51 = 34.
85 - 34 = 51, but we need subtraction, not addition.
Now, let me focus on the division and rest. 
Since 51 - 1. 5 = 51 - 1. 5 * 1 = 51 - 1. 5 = 51 - 1. 5 = 51 - 1 = 50. 
51 - 1 = 50.
So, let's check:
51 - 1 = 50.
The only rest we need to make this equation correct with the given numbers is to introduce the 1, which we can derive from 86 - 85.
<answer>(51 - (86 - 85))</answer>
</think>

==============
<think> Since 38 is relatively close to 60 and 21, it makes sense to use 60 as a starting point. The number 1 is very small and can be added or subtracted easily. If I take 60 and subtract 21, I get 39, very close to 38. If I subtract an extra 1 from the result, I'd get exactly 38. This matches our requirement of using all the numbers exactly once without complex operations. </think>
<answer> (60 - 21) - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the given numbers: 24, 49, and 41. We need to create an equation that results in 66 using each number exactly once. We can try various combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to see if it works.
 
One approach is to focus on the numbers we have: 24 and 41 are relatively close to 65, and 49 seems like it could potentially fill in the difference to form 66. 

Let's try subtraction:
49 - 24 = 25

This gives us 25, but we need 66. Let's think further:
41 + 25 = 66 

This uses 24 and 49, and we already have 41, so this works! </think>
<answer> 41 + (49 - 24) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers: 53, 3, and 74. We need to use these in some arithmetic operations to get 63. Since 53 is close to 63, subtraction or division might be helpful. 74 seems larger, and might be a good candidate for addition since it is far from 63, which could help offset using 53. We can try using 3 in the calculations since it's relatively small and could be manipulated to fit, either directly or indirectly by addition or multiplication.
We have two options: either subtract 53 from 74 or manipulate 74 in some way with 3 to help reach 63, while ensuring we use the 3 only once. Let's consider these:
1. Subtract 53 from 74: This gives us 21. Now we need another number that we can use to get to 63. We can't use 3 here since we've already decided to use it in the next step.
2. Using 3: We can look into multiplying or dividing 3 to get a number close to 63 or use it as part of an operation with 74 or 53.
Let's try 3 * 21 (from previous calculation). This gives us 63, but 21 isn't obtained from subtracting 53 from 74; instead, we use 3 to adjust this. </think>
<answer> (74 - 53) * 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to combine the numbers [51, 21, 60] to make 90 using basic arithmetic operations. I notice that 60 and 30 would make 90, and 30 is 21 + 9, where 9 comes from the number 51. So, my plan is:
1. Subtract 21 from 51 to get 30
2. Add 30 to 60 to get 90
Now, I have to use only once each of the numbers 51, 21, and 60. So, the equation would be:
<answer>(51 - 21) + 60</answer>
</think>

==============
<think> First, we need to use the numbers 10, 81, and 58, only once each, to make 13 using basic arithmetic operations.
Considering that 81 and 58 are larger numbers where subtraction seems promising, let's try subtracting them.
81 - 58 = 23
Now we have the numbers 10, 23, and we need to reach 13. Clearly, subtracting 10 from 23 should give us 13.
13 = 23 - 10
Our equation is now 81 - 58 - 10.
</think>
<answer> (81 - 58) - 10 </answer>

==============
<think> 
Firstly, I consider the possibility of using addition and subtraction. If I can get a big number by adding a couple of the numbers and then subtracting it with the rest, I may be able to get 43. 

Looking at the numbers 30 and 56, I might be able to get a sum or difference which, when subtracted from 76, could lead to 43.
</think>

The closest I can get from adding 30 and 56 is 86. Subtracting 76 from this gives 10. This is too small. 

Next, I consider the possibility of subtracting smaller numbers from a bigger one. 

Let's subtract 7 from 56, which leaves me with 49. If I can get this by adding or subtracting 7, 30 and a number from the last digit, then I have a chance.
</think>

Now, the closest I can get from subtracting 30 and 7 is 23. However, I need 10 more to get 43. If I subtract 23 from 76, I get 53, which means the remaining number must be -23. This seems strange as we're not dealing with negative numbers.

Let's try the other way around, using the remaining two numbers.
</think>

Now, 76 minus 49 equals 27. Since 76 minus 49 equals 27 and we need to get to 43, we need 16 more using remaining numbers. Since 30 minus 7 equals 23, adding this to 27 also doesn't work. Let's look at the possibility of using the multiplication and division.
</think>

From the remaining numbers, 30 and 56, 30/7 equals roughly 4.285, and this doesn't make 16 either. However, considering 30/7, we get 4 with a remainder of 2, which together with the other numbers does not fit 43.

Given the above steps, another possible calculation is using the last number 7.
</think>

Considering the number 7, we can multiply it by 6, which gives us 42. However, we need 43, which means we should take 30 and 7, and find a way to get 43. Since multiplication and division don't help in this case, it seems the only reasonable way is subtraction.

Another approach is subtracting 7 from 30, which gives 23, then adding 76 and subtracting 56 results in 43.
</think>

Therefore, the equation that equals to 43 using the numbers [30, 7, 56, 76] and only one arithmetic operation is:

<answer> (30 - 7) + 76 - 56 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 37 using the numbers 56, 31, and 3, one approach is to try different combinations of these numbers and operations.
One interesting pattern I notice is that 56 can be manipulated to produce a number close to 37. If we subtract 3, we get 53, which is reasonably close to 37. Then we're going to need to adjust the calculation to reach exactly 37.
Another is the number 31. Might there be a way to add 31 and 3 to get 37? Try 31 + 3, which makes 34; this is close but not yet there.
The only operation left is subtraction, so I'll subtract this from 53. 53 - 31 = 22, then 22 - 3 = 19, and finally, 19 + 31 = 50.
This method doesn't look promising. Let's examine another possibility - multiplying 31 by 3 and subtracting 56. 31 * 3 = 93 and 93 - 56 = 37.
This seems to work! So the equation would be 31 * 3 - 56 equals 37.</think>
<answer>31 * 3 - 56</answer>

==============
<think> Since the target number is 86 and we need to make an equation using the numbers [19, 67, 38] exactly once, I should consider all possible combinations of mathematical operations. We're looking at operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multiplying or dividing by 38 could be helpful, as 38 is close to 40 (which is useful for getting close to 86 from 67). 
19 + 67 = 86 seems a direct and straightforward route but checking other possible combinations, we can see:
    67 - 19 = 48. This seems too far from 86.
    To bridge the gap from 48 to 86 using 38, I can consider the following: 86 - 38 = 48, and then add 19.
So the equation involves some combination of subtraction and addition or subtraction and a further operation to reach 86: (67 - 19) + 38 = 86. </think>
<answer>(67 - 19) + 38</answer>

==============
<think>Initially, I have three numbers: 25, 11, and 5. I need to use each of them exactly once and any combination of the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to create an expression that evaluates to 55. Let's consider the structure of the equation first. Given that 55 is a relatively large number compared to the others, a possible strategy includes multiplication or division to simplify things. 25 could be a good candidate for the multiplication or division as it's a large number that could potentially get scaled to 55. So, a strategy would be to use 25 as a scaling factor to get 55 when combined with another number. If 11 used as a multiplier would result in 275, which is too large and exceeds 55. If 11 is used as a divisor, it would become 2.33, which also is not an appropriate step as it would require further operations to get to 55 using 5.
Now, consider another possibility: Might it be helpful to use 5? Let's think about division or multiplication. 5 is twice 2.5 which highlights the notion of division to get to 2.5. That is a path worth exploring.
So, let's consider the equation could be (25 * 11 / 5). This would give us 25 * 2.2 which equals 55.
</think>
<answer>(25 * 11 / 5)</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's reconsider the numbers we have - 10, 87, and 15. We need to create an equation that results in 82 using these numbers exactly once, with the given operations. 

One way to approach this is to think about the contributions of the individual numbers and see how we can manipulate them. For instance, 87 is quite close to 82 but we need to reduce it somewhat so that adding something else results in 82.

- If we add 15 to 87, we get 102, which is too high. So, we need to subtract a number to get 82.
- If we subtract 15 from 87, we get 72. Now, we need 6 more to result in 82.
- The number 10 is what we need for the extra 6 (since 10 - 4 = 6).
- So, combining these, we get a possible equation: 87 - 15 + 10 = 82.

This seems to satisfy the problem. However, the operations we chose are addition, subtraction, and the order of operations should be respected. Thus, we need to ensure those are valid arithmetic operations too.
</think>
<answer> 87 - 15 + 10 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider the order of operations. We have addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to work with. We need to generate 21 from the numbers 52, 34, and 65. I notice that if I can bring down 52 and 34 to zero, as long as I then subtract 65, I will get the desired result of 21.
A strategy could be to use subtraction to try to eliminate numbers. Let's start with 52 - 65. This equals -13. Now I have -13 and 34. If I add 34 to these two, I get -13 + 34 = 21. Thus, my equation is 52 - 65 + 34 = 21.
</think>
<answer> (52 - 65) + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find an equation using the numbers 41, 81, and 55 that equals 95. 
I should look for multiplication or addition and subtraction steps that could lead to 95. 
Multiplying or dividing should be considered first as it can transform numbers quickly.
Starting with the number 81, I can notice that multiplying 81 by 1 will keep the number the same.
Then, adding or subtracting 41 and 55 might help me reach 95. 
55 - 41 = 14 and 81 * 1 = 81. Adding 14 to 81 doesn't equal 95.
Let's try another approach with 81 * 1 and 41 - 55.
41 - 55 = -14, and 81 * 1 + (-14) = 81 - 14 = 67.
This doesn't work either.
I'll have to try the other order: 55 - 41 = 14 and 81 * 1 = 81. Subtracting 14 from 81 still doesn't equal 95.
Given these steps, it seems I've been approaching this incorrectly. The key is to think of how combining numbers and using different operations may lead to 95.
Considering 81 - 55 = 26 and then adding 41, this seems promising.
81 - 55 = 26 and 26 + 41 = 67, not 95.
Then I'll try with 55 - 41 = 14 and then 81 + 14 = 95.
81 + 14 = 95 and this looks promising as I'm achieving the target number 95 using different operations.
Thus, the final equation is 81 + 55 - 41 = 95.
</think>
<answer>81 + 55 - 41</answer>

==============
<think> First, the goal is to create an arithmetic equation using the numbers 28, 56, and 49 that results in 35. We have the options of using basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). 

Looking at the numbers given, we notice that 49 is almost exactly twice 28 (49 = 2 * 28). This could be useful. 

We need to do these operations in a way that results in 35. One way to get closer to 35 would be to perform some kind of combination on the numbers. 

Let's try: 
(56 - 49) + 28.
56 - 49 = 7.
7 + 28 = 35.
</think>
<answer>(56 - 49) + 28</answer>

==============
<think> First, consider the numbers provided: 5, 67, and 84. We need to achieve the result 22 using each number only once.
Start by recognizing that some quick mental math with the numbers suggest 84 can be manipulated to be close to 22. Since division by 4 would yield 21 or 21. 5, and result in a non-integer, we can't use that.
Think about multiplication and division together; notice 22 is closer to 67 than to 5 or 84. Therefore, using 67 for the other part of the equation seems reasonable. Now, 67 - 25 would equal 42, but dividing by 3 does not work as 3 is not present. 
All that remains is 84 - 67 = 17, which is too high.
Then, consider the division operation. Dividing 67 by 3 does not yield an integer. But, if we deal with 67 - 17 (which we got from the division step), we are left with 50. Now, 84 - 50 = 34, which is again not equal to 22.
Upon examining the numbers again, realize there's a gap in considering all potential combinations. Thinking more on 67 - 45 gives 22, which needs 45 made from 5 and 84. Subtracting 84 by 40 does not get us closer. 
However, let's try 84 - 62 which equals 22. But 84 - 62 does not fit the constraints of using only 5 once and then trying to create the rest from 67 through an operation. 
Given all this, let's try another approach directly using 5, 67, and 84 together without recalculating. 
- We can consider 84 - 67 = 17, and 5 + 17 = 22, which indeed works. Hence, the equation derived is: 84 - 67 + 5 = 22.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 67 + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 23, 89, and 23 in a single equation that equals 89. 
Since 89 is a large number, it's likely that an addition or multiplication might be involved.
Considering I can only use each number once, I can't add any other number to 23 or to 89 to achieve 89.
Multiplying 23 by any number won't get me to 89 since 23 * 4 = 92 (too high) and 23 * 3 = 69 (too low).
Given that 89 is a prime number and close to 90, let's think about operations involving 23 and 89.
I know I would need to remove 2 to make 89 from 23 and 89, since 23 + 89 - 2 = 110 -2 = 89.
So I'll use the equation: (23 + 89) - 23 = 89.
Let me double-check: 23 + 89 equals 112, and if we subtract 23 from that, we get 89 exactly.
</think>
<answer>(23 + 89) - 23</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 23, 89, and 23, each only once, to create an equation that equals 89. 
I can start by considering the roles of each number. Since 89 is quite far from 23, I need to either add or subtract large values to get 89. Trying 23 + 23 doesn't work because it's only 46, and adding 23 more doesn't bring it to 89. 
This leaves us with multiplying and dividing. 89 divided by 23 gives approximately 3.83 and does not result in an integer. So, division doesn't seem useful here.
Multiplying the numbers 23 and 23 gives 529, which is much greater than 89 and doesn't help.
The only option now is subtraction, but 89 - 23 = 66 is still greater than 89, so another large value needs to be subtracted.
Since 89 needs to be reduced, and 23 is the closest number to 89, subtracting 23 twice might work.
23 - 23 = 0. I need to find a way to make 23 from the remaining 23 and 89 using only subtraction or addition.
23 - 23 = 0 doesn't give me 23, but if I use the remaining 89 and subtract 23, I get 66.
Now, I need to subtract 66 from 23 to reach 89. Therefore, 23 - 66 will give me -43, which is not 89.
However, 89 - 66 is what we need. So I can construct the equation as 89 - (23 - 23).
That means the final equation should be (89 - (23 - 23)) = 89.
</think>
<answer> (89 - (23 - 23)) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 52, 85, and 36 once each to get 69. 
Considering I have two large numbers (52 and 85), I might think about subtraction first since these are bigger numbers, and I need to go a bit lower to get to 69. 
52 - 36 = 16.
So, to reach 69, I now have to add 53. 
Looking at the remaining number, 85, 53 is close, but not a match. 
Then, 85 - 52 = 33. 
So, now I need to add 33 to 16. That would give me 49, not 69.
Now, I need to investigate other possibilities. 
The second largest number is 85. Using division and subtraction, I can approach the answer. 
85 - 52 = 33 (This was a part of my previous calculation).
Using 33, I could try to make it equal 36. 
36 is 3 * 12.
So, 33 + 3 = 36.
Now if I add this to 16 from the first step, 16 + 36 = 52. 
This means, 85 - 52 = 33, and 33 + 16 = 69.
Therefore, 85 - 52 + 36 = 69. </think>
<answer> 85 - 52 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I'll consider all the basic arithmetic operations for using each of the three numbers [14, 9, 36] exactly once. An initial look shows that multiplication and division do not immediately lead to a simplifyable equation using these numbers.
Adding 14 and 9 gives 23. This is close to 13, so subtraction from 36 could be interesting.
36 - 23 = 13
Considering this, I can create the equation using the numbers:
14 + (36 - 9)
Let's verify this equation:
14 + (36 - 9) =>
14 + 27 =>
31
This does not give us 13, so I need to rethink. 
The initial equation should directly use subtraction for simplicity. Thus, the equation will be:
36 - 14 - 9
36 - 23 = 13
Hence the equation is right.
</think>
<answer> 36 - 14 - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 22, 4, and 58 to create an equation equaling 76. Let's start by looking at the most straightforward way to approach this.
- First, 58 is quite close to 76, so it might be a good idea to subtract it from 76 to see what is left, which should then match the other two numbers.
- 76 - 58 = 18. Now we need to create 18 using 22 and 4.
- 22 - 4 = 18. This means we can use these basic arithmetic operations to create our equation.
Thus, our equation is 22 - 4 + 58 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 22 - 4 + 58 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the target number, which is 60. 
The given numbers are 43, 59, and 76.
I need to arrange these numbers using operations to form 60.
Looking at the numbers, it looks like 76 - 59 might be useful as it gives 17.
Now, I need another number that, when operated with 17, will result in 60.
I see that if I add 43 to 17, I will get 60.
So, using the numbers in the order given, I can use subtraction and addition:
1. 76 - 59 = 17
2. 17 + 43 = 60
Therefore, the equation can be written as (76 - 59) + 43.
</think>
<answer>(76 - 59) + 43</answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the target equation (60). The numbers given are 83, 15, and 8.
We should start by examining the numbers for any obvious subtractions that could simplify another number to make the equation easier to manage.
- If we subtract 83 by 15, we get: 68. This leaves us with 8 to make 60. 
- If we subtract 8 from 68, we get 60. It looks promising.
So, our equation seems to be 83 - 15 - 8 = 60. Checking, this works.
Thus, the equation is: (83 - 15) - 8 = 60.
</think>
<answer>(83 - 15) - 8</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider that the target sum of 52 seems achievable through addition or subtraction while using the numbers 98, 45, and 1.
We know 98 is a large number and could quickly skew the sum towards a much larger number. Therefore, I'll aim to reduce 98 and the other numbers will be added to it.
Notice 1 + 45 = 46. If we subtract this from 98, we get 52. So 98 - (1 + 45) = 52.
So, the equation would be (98 - (1 + 45)).
</think>
<answer> (98 - (1 + 45)) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 98, 45, and 1 that equals 52. Starting with the numbers given, I can immediately see that subtracting 1 from 98 can easily bring me close to the desired result:
98 - 1 = 97
Now I need to reduce 97 to 52 by using 45. Subtracting 45 from 97:
97 - 45 = 52
Therefore, the equation uses these steps:
98 - 1 - 45 = 52
</think>
<answer>(98 - 1 - 45)</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 87, 12, and 78 to create an equation that equals 21 using basic arithmetic operations. 
I notice that 12 is the smallest and fairly simple number, which can be useful.
I can subtract 78 from 87 to get 9. 
Now I need to get 12 to 9. 
Dividing 12 by 12 gives me 1. 
Now the equation is 9 - 1, which equals 8.
To reach 21, I need to multiply 8 by 2.5, but multiplications are not permitted.
Looking for another approach, I realize that when I subtract 78 from 87, I get 9, which is close to 12.
I can add 12 to 9, which would give me 21.
Therefore, the equation is 9 (result of 87 - 78) + 12 = 21. 
I need to confirm this equation.
</think>
<answer> (87 - 78) + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 5, 15, and 45. We need to create an equation that equals 25 using each number only once and any combination of basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is by exploring potential combinations of these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Looking at the numbers, we see that 45 - 15 = 30. Now, we can try subtracting 5 from 30:
30 - 5 = 25.
This gives us our equation: 45 - 15 - 5 = 25.
We must verify that each number is used only once and the arithmetic is valid. This works because the 5, 15, and 45 are all used once, and performing the operations yield the correct result of 25.
</think>
<answer> (45 - 15) - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers and their potential roles in achieving the target number 77. The numbers are 48, 6, and 85. One useful approach would be to start with the larger number, 85, and subtract from it other numbers to reach the target.
85 - 48 is 37, which is close but not quite 77. The difference is 40, which might be obtained by combining 6 and 8. Since 6 * 8 = 48 is too much, let's try 6 * 8 / 4 or 6 * 8 / 2.
Checking 6 * 8 / 4 = 12, still not 40. Let's try 6 * 8 / 2 = 24. The difference is still 16.
Now let's consider 85 - 6 * 8 = 85 - 48 = 37, which needs an additional 40 to reach the target value. But we didn't have 40 yet, let's check the remaining 48 in another way. 
85 - 6 - (48/6) = 85 - 6 - 8 = 71, still doesn't work.
Having to do more trial and error, let's use 85 - 48 - 6 = 31 to go towards our target. 31 + 46 (required to make 77) isn't directly feasible with our numbers, so let's try: 
85 - 6 / 4 * 8 = 85 - 1.5 * 8 = 85 - 12 = 73, still short by 4. 6 / 4 * 8 is 12, we need 25 to get the 77. Let's reconsider this approach.
Instead of 6 / 4 * 8, consider 6 + 8 * 4 = 6 + 32 = 38, still not there. 
Now, 85 - 48 - 6 / 4 = 85 - 48 - 1.5 = 37.5, still need 39.5 to reach the target 77. 
I don't see combinations that work for the rest of the numbers directly. Let me try reassembling it differently:
85 - 6 / 4 * 8 + 48 / 8 = 85 - 12 + 6 = 79, which is wrong.
None of the straightforward multiplications or divisions with the numbers work directly either. Let's try another approach using reverse operations:
85 - 48 / 6 = 85 - 8 = 77. This gives us the exact 77.
</think>
<answer> 85 - 48 / 6 </answer>

==============
<think> The numbers given are 48, 51, and 44. We need to use these with basic arithmetic operations to produce 41.
First, I'll note that since 41 is quite close to 44, I could consider subtracting 3 (either from 44 or using a combination with another number). 51 is quite close, and could be the larger number used directly or indirectly in some way.
Looking at the operations, division and multiplication might be useful for getting numbers closer or further away.
- If I subtract 3 from 51, I get 48, exactly what I have! 
- So the equation now looks like 48 - 51 + 44.
Now, 48 - 51 indeed equals -3, but adding 44 gives us 41.
Therefore, my equation is 48 - 51 + 44 = 41.
</think>
<answer> 48 - 51 + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the goal: We need to create an equation that equals 71 using the numbers 56, 8, and 7, each only once. We should test different combinations with the arithmetic operations to see which ones work.
- One way to approach this is to consider if any of the numbers, when used as a base, could be operated on in some way to get closer to 71.
- Let's start with 56, which is closer to 71. We can try a mix of addition and subtraction:
  - Try adding 7 to 56: 56 + 7 = 63.
    This is quite close but less than our target.
  - Now, let's use 8 to see how we can modify 73.
    - Adding 8 to 63: 63 + 8 = 71.
    This brings us exactly to our target of 71.
So, we've identified that we should use 56 as the base number, add 7, and then add 8 to reach the target of 71. </think>
<answer> (56 + 7) + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the numbers available: 73, 96, and 39. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 16.
- I'll start by checking if any of the numbers, when used alone, comes close to 16. This test won't work but will provide a start.
- Now, I will look for a combination of operations and numbers that can result in 16:
  - Notably, 96 is a large number and 39 is a reasonably large number. Their sum is 135, which is far from 16.
  - As the direct sum is too large, I'll consider other operations. If I subtract 39 from 96, I get 57. This is also too large and not a factor that will make 16.
  - Now, if I take the other two numbers and check their operations:
    - 73 - 96 would give me -23, which is not useful.
    - 73 - 39 = 34, which is too large.
    - 73 + 39 = 112 (or 112 / 7 or 7 * 16), but 112 does not lead us to 16. 
  - Multiplying numbers is not yielding meaningful results either.
  - I'll then look at the combinations involving subtraction and division.
    - 96 / 39 = 2.46, far from 16.
    - 73 / 39 = 1.87, also far from 16.
    - Then, 96 - 39 = 57, this gives a good working point. 
    - If I subtract 57 from 73, I get 16.
So, I find that 73 - (96 - 39) = 16.
</think>
<answer> 73 - (96 - 39) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to find a way to use the numbers 8, 8, and 35 to get 51. First, I'll consider all basic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I notice that 35 is the largest number, so it's likely to be used as a multiplier or in a way to increase the number. I also see that 51 is two more than 49, which is 7 times 7. If I can somehow manipulate 8 and 8 to get one of these numbers, I might be able to work towards 51. 
Since the goal is 7, I think dividing 35 by 5 might work, as 35 divided by 5 is 7. Working with the remaining number 8, I need to adjust it to get to 49 rather than 5. Multiplying 8 by 6 would do the job, but I only have two 8s left, so 8 + 8 = 16. Now, 16 + 35 = 51.
This adds up, and we've used each number only once.
</think>
<answer> (8 + 8) + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 1, 91, and 30 in the equation to get 60. The target number is 60, and I can use the basic arithmetic operations. The number 30 looks like it could be useful as 30 is a multiple of 6, which is a factor of 60. If I can somehow manipulate 1 and 91 to get 60, that would be helpful.
Firstly, if I subtract 30 from 91, I get 61 (91 - 30 = 61), which is close to 60 but not quite there.
A negative number or a division could help here. Subtracting 1 will give me 60 (61 - 1 = 60).
The equation combining all these parts is: (91 - 30 - 1) = 60.
</think>
<answer>(91 - 30 - 1)</answer>

==============
<think> I recognize we need to use the numbers 63, 98, and 46 to get 81. Given the constraint of using basic arithmetic operations, let's consider the medium value 46, which seems to be the most versatile to work with given the other two numbers.
I check the operations:
- Multiplication: 46 * 1.75 = 80.5, which is close but not exact.
- Addition: 46 + 35 = 81. This seems promising.
So, 46 + 35 = 81.
Now, 35 is not directly obtainable from 63 and 98 but if we look at the given numbers, 98 - 63 = 35, which means 35 is already within the set. Therefore, the equation is formed.
</think>
<answer> 46 + (98 - 63) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers we have: 94, 94, and 89. 
Since 94 + 94 equals 188, which is greater than 89 and 94 - 94 equals 0, neither of these operations will work. 
We need to subtract 89 from one of the 94s. 
Now let's subtract 89 from 94: 94 - 89 = 5. 
Thus, we have 5 and 94 left. We can do 94 - 5 = 89. 
Therefore, the equation would be: 94 - (94 - 89) = 89.
</think>
<answer> 94 - (94 - 89) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 74 using the numbers 49, 29, and 54, we should first consider the most straightforward approach. We need to look at how we can manipulate these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to reach 74.
One easy approach could be to use all three numbers. Let's start by multiplying 54 by 2 (using 29):
54 * 2 = 108
This is close but exceeds 74, and using another number seems unnecessary since we only have one more chance to use a number or an operation. 
Considering addition and subtraction, let's see if we can get 74 by adding or subtracting:
49 + 29 = 78 (too high)
29 + 54 = 83 (too high)
49 - 29 = 20 (too low)
We need to find a way to reduce the sum. Now, let's consider if we can add or subtract a number to or from another. Let's try 54 - 29:
54 - 29 = 25
Now, we have 25 + 49:
25 + 49 = 74
Therefore, the equation that uses the numbers [49, 29, 54] to equal 74 is 54 - 29 + 49.
</think>
<answer> 54 - 29 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers 93 and 71. If we get these two values close to 133 (which is 2 * 66), we can then adjust using the third number, 98. 
93 + 71 = 164
Since 164 is slightly too high, we need to subtract from this.
164 - 98 = 66
This works because 93 + 71 - 98 equals 66 exactly.
We have used each number once.
</think>
<answer> (93 + 71) - 98 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 11, 25, and 18 to get an equation that equals 18. I'll start by thinking about how division or subtraction could help me reduce the total from 25 to 18. 
 Dividing 25 by a number gives me 18, where the divisor would need to be a little more than 25/18, approximately 1. 39. The integers near that could be 2 or 3.
 If 18 is the result of 25 divided by a number, I can use 25 / 2 = 12. 5. Since we need whole numbers, 25 / 3 equals approximately 8. 33, which is also not quite 18. 
But, if I rearrange, I get 25 - 25 / 3, which equals 25 - 8. 33 = 16. 67. This is close, but not quite 18.
Then, considering 18 is the target number, we can try to combine all numbers to achieve exactly 18. By looking at remaining number, 11, we can think about subtraction. If we use 11 - 1, it results in 10. So we need another number that can make 18.
Since 18 is greater than 10, if we take the previous result (16. 67) and manipulate it, we could consider adding 18. Since 16. 67 + 18 = 34. 67, which is too large.
Instead, think about multiplying 11 by the other numbers. Multiplying 11 by 25 / (18) is not yielding a simpler result than division.
However, we can use the number 18 in the equation. If 18 is the target, try 18 + (25 - 11) = 18 + 14 = 32. This is slightly off and incorrect.
Finally considering addition works if we take 25 + 11 - 18, which equals 25 + 11 - 18 = 36 - 18 = 18.
 </think>
<answer> 25 + 11 - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> Starting with the numbers [19, 14, 37], to make a sum of 32, we need to explore different combinations of arithmetic operations.
Notice that 37 is already quite large and 19 is relatively small. Therefore, subtracting 19 from 37 seems like a good starting point.
So, 37 - 19=18.
Now we have 18 and 14 to work with, and we need to reach 32. Adding 14 equals 32, so 18 + 14 = 32.
So the equation that fits these numbers is: 37 - 19 + 14 = 32.
</think>
<answer> 37 - 19 + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's identify the numbers we have: 19, 14, and 37. We need to use these to make an equation that equals 32.
- Trying to subtract 19 from 37 gives us 18, but this doesn't work.
- If we add 14 to 19, we get 33, which is close but not quite there.
- The number 14 is involved in a close operation, so let's try to use it. If we subtract 14 from 37, we get 23.
- Now we need 9 more to reach 32.
- Since 19 is the only number that can yield this 9 with the smallest complexity, let's subtract 10 from 19.
- Therefore, we're using 19 - 10 = 9.
Putting it all together, we get: 14 + 37 - 19 = 32.
</think>
<answer> 14 + 37 - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine the numbers 34, 55, and 75 to get to 54. Looking at the numbers, 75 and 55 are close to 54; it seems subtracting 75 - 55 might be useful. Let's try combining this with the remaining number, 34, using multiplication or addition. However, subtracting 55 from 75 gives us 20, which when combined with 34, doesn't yield 54 easily.
Considering the target of 54, I think dividing or using multiplication could help if we combine numbers differently. If I subtract 55 from 75, then divide the result by 34, we will get 20/34. This seems closer but not exact.
Another approach could be rearranging the order. Let's check if 75 - 34 subtracted from 55 equals 54. Doing this calculation: 55 - (75 - 34) = 55 - 41 = 14 is not correct.
Finally, let's try this: 55 - 34 + 75, which equals 21 + 75 = 96. This is still not 54.
Now, I find that 75 - 55 = 20. If we use 34 - 20, we get 14, which still is not 54.
The solution seems to be combining these in a different way. Since we're trying to reach 54, and 75 - 20 = 55, this is not helping. I need to consider if multiplying or combination in a different order will work.
After careful consideration, combining 75 and 34 in a way we haven't tried yet is 75 - (34 * 1) + 55. This way we use 34 as 34 itself, then remove its effect through subtraction, then add 55 to it. Let's calculate this:
75 - (34 * 1) + 55 = 75 - 34 + 55 = 41 + 55 = 96.
The issue seems we need to subtract 42, but we cannot change the numbers. Since we need to solve the equation using only once, this approach doesn't work.
Actually, considering the 34, 55, and 75 numbers more directly and using subtraction and addition, the equation 75 - 55 + 34 = 54 gives us the answer 54.
</think>
<answer> 75 - 55 + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I should consider how the numbers can be combined to reach 62 using basic operations. One efficient approach would be to start with the largest number, 98, to increase the result quickly. 98 is close to 100, so I might consider subtracting a smaller number from it or adding a smaller number to it.
Considering subtraction, I can think of this way:
98 - 36 = 62
Now, I need to form 36 using the smaller numbers, 52 and 16.
In a similar thought process, I can see:
52 - 16 = 36
Therefore, putting this together, I get:
98 - (52 - 16) = 62
This equation satisfies all conditions: it uses every number only once and results in 62.
</think>
<answer> 98 - (52 - 16) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 59, 26, and 40 exactly once to make 73 using basic arithmetic operations. 
First, I'll think about how 59 could contribute to 73. Adding 14 to 59 would give us 73, but we only have the numbers 26 and 40 to create 14.
Multiplying 26 by 0.5 would give 13, not exactly 14. But subtracting 40 from 26 would give a negative number, which wouldn't help in reaching 14.
Given the constraints and the target being 14, we may have to use division or addition in a different combination.
X divided by 26 could be 13/26, but this fraction doesn't work since we need whole numbers. So, let's consider multiplication of 26 and 40.
26 * 40 = 1040, this is too large. 
And 59 + 26 + 40 would exceed 73.
From 59, 26, and 40, the only combination that gives a useful result when combined with the other numbers is 59 - 26. This gives 33.
Now, if I add 40 to 33, I get 73.
So, the equation would be: 59 - 26 + 40 = 73.
</think>
<answer> 59 - 26 + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers available: 28, 55, 44, and 51.
We need an equation that equals 90.
One of the numbers seems promising for addition since 55 + 35 = 90, but 35 is not in our list.
Next, let's consider multiplication and subtraction. If we take 51 * 1. 8 = 91. 8, which is close to 90, but still not there.
Let's try division. If we divide 55 by ½ (or 0. 5, equivalent to 2), we get 110. If we subtract 20 from 110, we get 90.
So, we can construct the equation as (55 / 0. 5) - 20.
However, since we can't use 0. 5, we need to find another way using only integers. 
We can use 44 - 28 = 16, and then we need to get 74 from 90, which can be achieved as 55 + (90 - 55) = 90, which simplifies to 51 + 28.
Combining these, we can get: (28 + 51) - (44 - 55 / 0. 5)
But since we can't use decimal numbers, we'll transform this to (28 + 51) - (44 - 55 * 2), which simplifies to: 79 - (-70) = 149 is not correct.
Thus, a simpler and straight-fit, yielding correct answer, is:
(55 - 44) + 51 which equals 61. Adding 69 is not correct, as that becomes 120.
Realizing 28 + (55 - 44) + 51 = 90 fits the equation.
</think>
<answer> (28 + (55 - 44)) + 51 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 94, 1, 77, and 31 to create an equation that equals 47. 
First, I notice that 94 - 77 = 17. This is a key number I can work with.
Next, I see that 17 is not quite close to 47. If I could multiply 17 by 2, I would get 34, which is more close to 47.
The number 34 is very close to 47. But I need 31 to produce 34, which means 31 - 1 = 30.
Thus, my equation so far is 17 + 30 = 47.
Since 17 can be created as (94 - 77), and 30 comes from (31 - 1), I'll use these to create my final equation:
(94 - 77) + (31 - 1) = 47.
</think>
<answer>(94 - 77) + (31 - 1)</answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that equals 53 using the numbers 16, 17, and 52. 
- First, let's consider the possibility of subtracting and adding numbers. The result 53 suggests that the sum of two numbers can be 54 (since we can subtract 1 to get 53). 
- Looking at the numbers, 52 is the largest and could be used first in such a calculation.
- 52 + 17 = 69, and then to get 53, we need to subtract 16. 
- So the equation will be 52 + 17 - 16
- This equation sums up all numbers once and gives us the desired result of 53.
 </think>
<answer> (52 + 17) - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I notice that 91 - 81 = 10 and 41 + 10 = 51. So, one way to form 51 is to add 10 to 41. Now, to find 10, I can use 91 - 81 = 10. Thus, the equation is 41 + (91 - 81) = 51. </think>
<answer> 41 + (91 - 81) </answer>

==============
<think> To form an equation using 58, 99, and 53 that equals 12 with each number only being used once and basic arithmetic operations, I should evaluate the numbers and see how they can be manipulated.
First, let's look at the numbers closely: 58, 99, 53. Adding or subtracting these gives results that are far from 12. Multiplying or dividing individual numbers by each other also doesn't seem to work out easily.
One approach is to see if we can manipulate these numbers through operations such as using a fraction or a combination that simplifies to 12. 
Consider: division or the subtraction and addition of such operations might be useful. 
Given that 53 is relatively close to 58, subtracting 53 from 58 equals 5. Now we need to combine this 5 with 99 in a way that divides to give 12.
Dividing 99 by 9 gives 11, and 5 times 11 does not equal 12. But 99 divided by 3 gives 33, and 5 times 33 equals 165.
Thus, dividing 99 by 3 and then multiplying the result by 5 gives:
\( \frac{99}{3} \times 5 = 33 \times 5 = 165 \).
Clearly, this approach doesn't match our target of 12. Trying another combination:
Consider: if we calculate 99 minus 53, it gives 46. Now if I subtract the result of 46 from 58, I get:
\( 58 - (99 - 53) = 58 - 46 = 12 \).
This gives us the result of 12 using the operations and numbers provided, each only once.
</think>
<answer> 58 - (99 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to create an equation using the numbers 63, 76, and 57 that equals 82. Let's think about the numbers we have and how we can combine them to get the result.
First, let's consider the possibility of addition and subtraction, as these are generally straightforward operators for combining or subtracting numbers.
We can start by adding numbers:
1. 63 + 76 = 139
2. 63 + 57 = 120
3. 76 + 57 = 133
All of these sums are too high.
Next, let's consider subtraction:
1. 76 - 63 = 13
2. 63 - 57 = 6
3. 57 - 63 = -6
All of these differences are too low.
The differences are not helping us reach our goal. Now, let's think about multiplication or division:
1. 63 * 76 = 4848
2. 63 * 57 = 3571
3. 76 * 57 = 4332
All of these products are far too high.
4. 63 / 76 ≈ 0.8241 (This is too low)
5. 76 / 57 ≈ 1.3397 (This is too high)
6. 57 / 63 ≈ 0.9048 (This is too low)
We haven't found a single mathematical operation that solves this problem using the numbers as they are. However, let's try the combination of these numbers.
Considering the remaining numbers and their combinations, let's test:
(76 - 63) + 57 = 13 + 57 = 70
This is still not the answer. Let's try another combination:
76 - (63 - 57) = 76 - 9 = 67
Still not correct. Trying another:
57 + 76 - 63 = 133 - 63 = 70
This is still not 82. Realizing our approach of combining numbers directly has not worked, let's re-examine. Since the direct combinations of 63, 76, and 57 are not working, we might consider the possibility that we need a different combination.
57 + (76 - 63) = 57 + 13 = 70
We need to return to our original numbers and re-examine the possibility of combining them in a different way. Since we haven't found it directly, we might need to think again. Let's assume we misinterpreted the combinations earlier. If we consider another operation like a combination of these:
63 - 57 + 76 = 6 + 76 = 82
This answer seems correct - 57 - 63 = -6 and 76 + (-6) = 70, thus subtracting -6 from 57 and adding 76 does indeed get us 82.
</think>
<answer> 63 - 57 + 76 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 49, 76, and 32 that equals 93. I should consider how addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be used to reach the desired outcome.
Firstly, 93 is close to 76, and 76 - 32 = 44. This seems like a likely starting point. If I add 49 to 44, I get 93. So, the equation that we're looking for should be 76 - 32 + 49 = 93.
Let's verify:
1) Subtracted 32 from 76, giving 44.
2) Added 49 to 44, which indeed equals 93.
This equation uses the three numbers exactly once, meeting the requirements. </think>
<answer> 76 - 32 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to evaluate the possibility of using the numbers 43 and 99 directly to get 99. That doesn't seem possible since 43 + 99 + 43 needs 43 twice. Next, I see that I can subtract 43 from 99, which gives me 56. Then, I can multiply 56 by 43 / 43, which gives me 56 * 1 = 56. This still doesn't get me 99.
Another possibility could be subtracting 43 from 99 to get 56 and then multiplying by 1 (via 43 / 43). But that gives me 56. I need to keep searching for a solution.
Hmm, another path could be: 99 - 43 = 56. With the remaining 43, I can apply it in other ways. If 56 is obtained, I can multiply or divide it to reach 99.
If I multiply 56 by 1. 875, I get 99. 875, which isn't exactly 99.  But if I try with 1. 875 * 56 = 99, I see it's not a standard fraction.
Finally, I realize that I can't get exactly 99 just by using the provided operations and numbers. The factor 1. 875 is not achievable with simple arithmetic operations using these limited numbers. So I need to conclude that it's not possible with just the numbers [43, 99, 43] with the given operations.
</think>
<answer>43 * (99 / 43)</answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to realize that the larger numbers 96 and 15 can be used to get numbers close to 89, and then we can use 8 to fine-tune the result.
Considering 96 and 15, if we subtract 15 from 96, we get 81.
Now, with 81, we need to get to 89. Adding 8 to 81 gives us 89. 
So, our equation would be: 96 - 15 + 8 = 89.
</think>
<answer> 96 - 15 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll assess the numbers and operations that can lead to 51. Given the numbers 36, 85, and 2, let's try to use each one specifically. 
I notice that using 2 as it is doesn't significantly alter the equation, so consider:
36 - 85 = -49, which needs to be adjusted.
Now adding 2 can help, but subtraction proved challenging, so let's try to use 36 with 85:
36 + 85 = 121, that's larger than 51.
Subtracting 2 from 85 gives: 85 - 2 = 83, which could be adjusted further.
Using addition or subtraction with 36 would need to isolate the difference close to 51:
36 + (36 - 2) = 36 + 34 = 70 - still too large.
Let's try:
(85 - 36) / 2 = 49 / 2 = 24.5 (doesn't work)
85 - (36 + 2) = 85 - 38 = 47 (still off).
We need to isolate a value of 51. 
Considering that 51 is close to 85, but we don't have enough from 85 to get 51, we must use the subtraction differently:
85 + 2 - 36 = 87 - 36 = 51.
Thus the equation combining all numbers, 36, 85, and 2 correctly is:
(85 + 2) - 36 = 51.
</think>
<answer>(85 + 2) - 36</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get close to 50 using the numbers 91, 68, and 27. 
I see that 91 and 68 are quite close, so if I use subtraction I can work towards 50.
91 - 68 = 23, which is closer but not exactly 50.
Now, I look at the remaining number 27. 
Multiplying 23 by 27 / 23 (or simply adding 27 to 23) will give me the value I need to reach 50.
91 - 68 + (27 * 23 / 23) = 91 - 68 + (27) = 50.
Thus, the equation is 91 - 68 + (27).
</think>
<answer> 91 - 68 + (27) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 96, 40, and 39 that results in 97. Let's analyze the numbers to see if they can be manipulated using basic operations to achieve this.
First, I'll try subtracting and adding the numbers:
96 - 40 - 39 = 17. This result is far from 97.
Next, I'll try to add 40 and 39 first:
40 + 39 = 79. Now I have 96 - 79 = 17, which again is not 97.
Then, I'll think about what needs to be adjusted. If I take 96 and add 40, I might get closer:
96 + 40 = 136. Now I need to subtract some number to get 97. 
Here's the critical part: already, 136 - 39 = 97, as 39 is the difference between 136 and 97.
So the equation would be 96 + 40 - 39 = 97.
 </think>
<answer> (96 + 40) - 39 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers provided: [54, 62, 68]. The target number we need to reach is 60.
One strategy is to reduce one or more of these numbers to get closer to 60.
If we subtract 62 by 2, we get 60. However, we can't subtract 2 because 2 isn't provided.
Next, let's try 54 + 6 = 60. This works because 54 + (62 - 6) = 54 + 56 = 110
To correct for this, we actually need to subtract 56 instead of adding 62 - 6.
Therefore, the equation becomes: 54 + (68 - 62) = 60.
</think>
<answer> 54 + (68 - 62) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 18, 12, and 44 that equals 14. I can use any of the basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/).
- First, let's consider the largest number, 44. Dividing 44 by the other two numbers doesn't seem to give us 14.
- Next, let's try multiplication. Multiplying any of these numbers by another would likely exceed 14.
- Now, let's consider subtraction. Subtracting a smaller number from a larger one could get us closer to 14.
- If I take 44 - 18, I get 26. This is too high. If I take 44 - 12, I get 32. This is also too high.
- However, if I take 44 - 12 - 18, I get 14. This looks promising as it equals the target number.
</think>
<answer> (44 - 12 - 18) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll break down the target number 92 and see if I can use the given numbers in a combination that approximates it. Considering the numbers given are 36, 98, and 42.
One approach is to use the larger number, 98, as it's closest to 92 and then use the other numbers to reach the exact target.
98 minus 42 equals 56.
Now, to get from 56 to 92, I need 36 extra.
So, 56 + 36 = 92.
Thus, the final equation is 98 - 42 + 36 = 92.
</think>
<answer> 98 - 42 + 36 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 78 using the numbers 49, 84, and 55 with basic arithmetic operations, I'll start by considering the target number and the operations we can use.
- The target is 78.
- 84 is closer to 78 than 55, so I might be able to use it directly or modify it with another number.
I notice that 84 - 55 = 29, which is close to 78 but still short. If I can reach 29, adding 49 would give me 78.
Now, 29 is far from the available numbers, and using 49 or 55 won't lead to a solution directly. But, let's try the combination.
- 55 - 49 = 6, which is close but not what we need.
Next, consider using division. If I divide 84 by the number left after using 55, I might get closer to 29. If 49 is divided by 55, that would give:
- 49 / 55 is approximately 0. 89 or close to 1, not what I need.
Since neither subtraction nor the division of 49 by 55 works, let's try another approach.
- Now, let's divide 84 by 55 which gives 1. 527, and multiply by 55 again:
- (55 * (84 / 55))
- This simplifies to 84, which still doesn't help us get 29.
However, let's reconsider the original numbers more clearly:
- The only viable operation I can do is 84 - 55 = 29.
- Then add 49 to get 78.
So, the equation becomes: 84 - 55 + 49 = 78.
</think>
<answer> 84 - 55 + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll think of the numbers and operations that could produce 46. Given the small result we need, addition and subtraction might not provide the range quickly. Multiplying by smaller numbers could help as well. 
Looking at the numbers, 57 is quite large and we need to reduce it to get to 46. 
Looking at 76 and 87, we can see that if we subtract 57 from 87, we get 30. 
30 + 16 would give us 46. 
So, focusing on 57 - 87 + 16 = 46.
However, 16 isn't in the set of numbers. 
Then, if we consider 57 - 87 = -30, then we'd need -76 + 106 = 46.
-30 + 106 = 76 is too big. 
-76 + 106 = 30, close to 46 but still not enough plus what we need to reach 46.
Let's simplify:
57 + (76 - 87) = 57 - 11 = 46.
This equation now equals 46 using the numbers only once and the allowed operations.
</think>
<answer> 57 + (76 - 87) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the given numbers: [82, 79, 59]. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once and the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get the result of 62.
We can start by looking at the properties of the numbers and the target number. The target number 62 seems reasonably close to one of our numbers, 82. If we can reduce 82, it seems likely we can achieve 62 by using the other numbers in some operation.
Let's consider 82 - 20. That would give us the number 62. Since we have 62 and we only have 59 left, subtracting 59 from 62 would give us 0, which is useless.
Another way to decrease 82 is to divide, like this: 82 / 2 = 41. Then, we're short of 21 to reach 62. Since we only have 79 left and 79 / 3 gives 26.33, which is not an integer we need, let's think of a different combination.
Now, let's consider multiplying and subtracting: 59 * x - y = 62. We need to find x and y such that x is 2 or 3 (since those were our original numbers) and y can be what's left. If y = 79, then 59 * 3 - 79 = 177 - 79 = 98, which is too large. If y = 82, then we already considered. Let's try 59 * 2 - 79 = 118 - 79 = 39, which is also too large.
Considering these failures, let's try another approach: Use subtraction and addition. 82 - 79 = 3, and 3 + 59 = 62. This combines all the numbers exactly once and uses + and - operations.
</think>
<answer> (82 - 79) + 59 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll start by considering that 91 is a relatively large number compared to our given numbers, especially 76. This means that we're likely going to use subtraction or multiplication to reach our target number.
Looking at the numbers 76 and 5, subtracting 76 from 5 is not going to make sense because we're near zero. So, I'll try using 5 and 20 or 76. 
Multiplying 20 by 5 gives us 100, which is too big. Dividing 5 by 20 results in a small fraction which is unlikely to make the equation equal 91.
The most logical way to approach this is to use 76 and either 5 or 20 in some subtraction operation together to get closer to 91.
Subtracting 5 from 76 results in 71. Now, we need an additional 20 to reach 91. Adding 20 to 71 gives us 91. 
Thus, the equation would be: 76 - 5 + 20 = 91.
</think>
<answer> 76 - 5 + 20 </answer>

==============
<think> To get from the numbers [99, 34, 2] to 63 using basic arithmetic operations, I'll need to experiment with different combinations of operations and order of numbers.
Taking 2 as the starting point, subtracting from or adding to 2 could result in something close to 61 or 63.
If I add 2 + 34 = 36, it's still quite far from 63.
If I subtract 2 from 34 = 32, it brings me closer.
Now, 99 - 32 = 67, which is near 63 but a bit too high.
If I subtract 99 - 36 = 63, we get the target number 63.
With all numbers used once and operations used once, the equation is: 99 - (34 + 2) = 63.
</think>
<answer> 99 - (34 + 2) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation using the numbers 50, 78, and 63 that equals 65, one approach is to use subtraction. 
First, I should consider if I can use subtraction to bring the numbers closer to 65. Let's try:
1. Subtracting 63 from 78, we get: 78 - 63 = 15.
2. Now we have 50, 15, and we need to reach 65.
3. Then, using the 50, we can calculate: 50 + 15 = 65.
So, we can now construct the equation 50 + (78 - 63).
</think>
<answer> (50 + 78 - 63) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's add 88 and 74: 
88 + 74 = 162

We have 162 and 67 left. Subtracting 67 from 162 would give us:
162 - 67 = 95

This equation works out perfectly. Therefore, 162 - 67 equals 95.
</think>
<answer> (88 + 74) - 67 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 4, 65, and 2 to equal 59. I'll try to use basic arithmetic operations to find a way to get this result.
First, I can subtract 2 from 65 to get 63. This might help because 63 is close to 59.
65 - 2 = 63
Next, I need to get from 63 to 59. I can subtract 4 from 63.
63 - 4 = 59
Now I have used all the numbers and the operations to achieve the target. So, my equation would be:
(65 - 2) - 4 = 59
</think>
<answer> (65 - 2) - 4 </answer>

==============
<think> To get to 70 using the numbers 81, 33, and 22 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations, I should start by considering the numbers and the target.
The numbers are 81 and 33 are quite large, while 22 is small. This means subtraction might be helpful to reduce the value.
33 - 22 = 11
Now we have 81 - 11, but this doesn't quite get us to 70 either. We need to find a way to adjust this result.
81 - 11 = 70
Since these operations directly use all numbers without needing division or combining, this equation is achievable.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 33 + 22 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 95, 19, and 30 that equals 46. 
First, let's consider what operations could feasibly get us from one of these numbers to 46. Using division and 95 could be a good start, as it's the largest number and could provide a larger value. But 95 divided by anything except 1 and itself won't help us reach 46. 
Next, if we consider addition, subtracting the other numbers can be helpful. Starting with 95, if we subtract 30, we get 65. We can subtract 19 from 65 to get 46. 
So the equation would be: 95 - 30 - 19 = 46.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 30) - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 76, 91, and 97 once each to create an expression that equals 70. 
First, observing the numbers, we can see that 97 and 91 are relatively close to 70, so subtracting 97 from 91 might be a good step.
91 - 97 = -6
Now we have 76, -6.
Adding 76 and -6 gives us:
76 + (-6) = 70.
So, the equation should be 76 + (91 - 97) = 70.
</think>
<answer> 76 + (91 - 97) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to approach the numbers [79, 22, 33, 47] and figure out how we can combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 87. 
Looking at these numbers, we notice that 79 and 47 are the largest and second largest numbers respectively. If we can form an equation where the result of combining 79 and 47 equals or closely approximates 87, it might help.
(79 - 47) = 32
Now, we need 55 more to reach 87. Looking at the remaining numbers 22 and 33, we can achieve this by their sum: 
(22 + 33) = 55
Thus, our equation would be: 79 - 47 + 22 + 33 = 87 
</think>
<answer> (79 - 47) + 22 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 13, 17, and 97 to reach 67 using basic arithmetic operations. Notice that the sum of 13 and 17 is 30, and subtracting this from 97 gives us 67. This suggests we could use addition and subtraction to achieve 67. 
Therefore, we can write the equation 97 - (13 + 17) = 67.
</think>
<answer> 97 - (13 + 17) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target result: 61.
Given numbers are 66, 72, and 55. 
Since 72 and 66 are quite close in value, there's a good chance using subtraction might get us close to 61.
Try to subtract 66 from 72, which gives us 72 - 66 = 6.
Now we need to get from 6 to 61. 
Adding 55 to 6 provides 6 + 55 = 61.
Thus, the equation can be built by combining 66, 72, 55, and our intermediate result step.
</think>
<answer> (72 - 66) + 55 </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation with the given numbers that equals 89 using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we first need to identify a pair of numbers whose sum or difference can be easily adjusted to 89 when combined with the others.
- The given numbers are 88, 20, 76, and 81.
- 88 and 20 sum to 108, which is close to our target but not quite right.
- Since direct addition or subtraction doesn't seem to work, we might try multiplication and division.
- Multiplying 88 by 1. 0416 (which is 20/19) would be an interesting route to achieve 89. However, multiplying by fractions directly isn't straightforward with these numbers.
- Instead, we look for combinations that might fit.
- If we use 88 - 20 = 68, then we're close to 61, need to get to 89.
- To make 61, we use 76 - 81 = -5, which is not helpful.
- Notice 81 - 76 = 5, and then need 89 - 5 = 84, which doesn't fit our numbers directly.
- Testing 81 + 20 = 101, then 88 - 101 = -13. Not what we're looking for.
- Trying multiplication: If we multiply 81 by 1. 087 (89/81), it's close but we can't use fractions.
- 81 * 1. 087 is not exact with our numbers.
- Thus, an acceptable approach seems to be to start with 81 + 8 = 89. We need 81 and 20 - 76 = -53 doesn't work directly.
- Now, 81 + 20 = 101, -12 for 89.
- Divide 101 - 89 = 12.
From the above thinking, the closest and possible way is 81 + 20 - (88 - 76) equals 89.
</think>
<answer> 81 + 20 - (88 - 76)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 36 using the numbers 75, 25, 86, and 98 with each number used only once.
- I'll start by looking at the target number, 36. It is less than 75 and 98 but more than 25, so let's try to structure an equation where these values can help us get to 36.
- Consider multiplication or division might help. Multiplication by 3 or 35 would help, but 75 does not divide evenly by 3. 
- Let's experiment with division. If we divide 75 by 25, we get 3, which is useful. However, we still need an additional value to turn 3 into 36. 
- We have 86 and 98 left. If we subtract 86 from 98, we get 12. From this, we can see if we can format our equation to achieve a 36. 
- Multiplying 12 by 3 gives us 36. So far, this looks promising. Let's check this: 
  75 / 25 = 3
  98 - 86 = 12
  12 * 3 = 36
- This fits the criteria, so our equation is correct. Now, I'll write this out clearly.
</think>
<answer> (75 / 25) * (98 - 86) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's examine the target sum we want to achieve, which is 65. We have three numbers available: 45, 68, and 42. 
Looking at these numbers, we can see that if we subtract 45 from 68, we get 23. Now, we need another number that when added to 23 gives us 65.
Lastly, we observe that 42 minus 17 equals 25, which in turn minus 2 equals 23.
23 + 42 = 65
This means we can use the equation 68 - 45 + 42 = 65.
</think>
<answer> 68 - 45 + 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target number, which is 91. The numbers we are given are 23, 15, and 99. I'll start by looking at 99 as a potential number to subtract from or add to 91, as it's the largest.
Subtracting gives: 99 - 91 = 8. This is not 91.
Adding 23 gives: 99 + 23 = 122. This is not 91.
Next, I'll look at the remaining number, 15. If I multiply 15 by a number to reach 91, I'll need to find which number, when multiplied by 15, gives 91. 91 / 15 = 6.066, which isn't an integer.
I'll try dividing 91 by 15: 91 / 15 = 6.066. This isn't an integer either.
Now let's multiply 15 by 23 to see if we can reach 91. 23 * 15 = 345. This is clearly higher than 91.
One last check: Subtracting 15 from 23 gives 8, and adding 99 to 8 gives 107, which is too high. The only feasible method now is using the numbers in their current form, but add them directly. 23 + 68 = 91.
So, the equation using the given numbers is 23 + 68 = 91. The number 68 is the sum of 15 and 99 which equals 114, then by subtracting 23, we get 91.
</think>
<answer> (15 + 99) - 23 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 71, 38, 8, and 34 using arithmetic operations to get 83. Let's try combining them in a few different ways:
1. Adding 71 and 34 gives 105, which is close but too high.
2. Subtracting 34 from 71 gives 37, which brings us closer.
3. Now, combining 37 with 38 adds up to 75, still a little too low.
4. Let's add 8 to 75, which makes 83 - exactly what we need!
Therefore, the equation becomes: 71 - 34 + 38 + 8 = 83
</think>
<answer> 71 - 34 + 38 + 8 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 85, 95, and 77 to get a result of 67 using basic arithmetic operations. 
First, let's consider the possibility of using subtraction to reduce the numbers. If I subtract 77 from 95, I get:
95 - 77 = 18
Now, the equation becomes 18 + 85 = 103, which is not the target number.
Next, I'll try subtracting 77 from 85:
85 - 77 = 8
This simplifies the equation to 8 + 95 = 103, which still doesn't match our target number.
Then, I'll try subtracting 95 from 85:
85 - 95 = -10
This seems to be a negative number, which doesn't look useful. 
Now, let's consider multiplication or division:
Multiplying 85 * 77 gives me 6545, which is far off from 67.
Dividing 95 by 77 gives me approximately 1.236, also not close to our goal.
Lastly, let's check if there is any way to use 85 directly along with the other number to reach 67:
The only combination that comes close using addition or subtraction is 85 - 18 = 67.
Since we have already figured out that 95 - 77 = 18, we found our solution.
Therefore, the equation is 85 - (95 - 77) = 67. </think>
<answer> 85 - (95 - 77) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 85, 95, and 77 to get 67. One way to approach this is to think about how to leverage the numbers in a way that can be simplified.
Let's consider subtracting the smallest number from the largest:
95 - 77 = 18
This leaves us with 85 and 18. Now, if we take 85 and subtract 18, we'll get 67:
85 - 18 = 67
Therefore, the equation is 85 - (95 - 77).
</think>
<answer> 85 - (95 - 77) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 42, 26, and 62 that results in 46. I will first observe each number and consider what kind of equation can be made from them. The number 46 seems like a feasible target as it's close to some of the other numbers. 
Considering the operations, multiplication and division could be useful since adding or subtracting the numbers in sequences doesn't appear to get me closer to 46. Let's look at 62 - 26 - 42. This doesn't equal 46. 
Next, let's try another combination. 62 - 42 - 26, this too doesn't work out. 
Let's try another approach. We can use division. 62 - 42 equals 20 and 26 / 6 = 4.666, so 20 - 4.666 seems to be closer but not quite right.
Considering the problem, the only combination that fits is 62 - 42 + 26. When we calculate this, we get 62 - 42 = 20 and then 20 + 26 = 46, which matches our target number.
</think>
<answer> 62 - 42 + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I will look at the given numbers 7, 17, 28, and 65 and consider how they might combine to give 27. One way to approach this is to try to make groups of numbers that sum up to a value close to 27.
One way to do this is to consider 65 and 17. If I subtract 17 from 65, I get:
65 - 17 = 48
Now I need to subtract another value to reach 27 from 48. So, if I subtract 21 from 48, I get:
48 - 21 = 27
Now I need to find the equivalent of 21 using the remaining numbers, which are 7 and 28. One way to do this is to use multiplication and addition: 7 + 28 = 35. However, to get 21, I need to divide 35 by some value. If I divide 35 by 2, I get 17.5, which isn't an integer. Instead, I can subtract 14 from 35: 35 - 14 = 21. We can obtain 14 by subtracting 7 from 21: 21 - 7 = 14.
Therefore, we have the equation:
65 - (17 + (28 - 7))
</think>
<answer> 65 - (17 + (28 - 7)) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 15, 79, and 51 to create an equation that equals 43. I should start by checking out possible combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's look at the numbers closely:
- 79 - 51 = 28 (which is not 43)
- 79 - 15 = 64 (which is not 43)
- 51 - 15 = 36 (which is not 43)
- 51 + 15 = 66 (which is not 43)
- Multiplying these numbers 79 * 15 = 1185 and 79 * 51 = 4089 and 51 * 15 = 765 also do not get me 43.
There was no obvious way to use these numbers together with the operations to get 43 directly, but I should reconsider each number with substitution and combination of operations.

- First, consider 79 - 51 = 28, which is not 43 but as an interim value, it might be useful.
- Then, 15 + 28 would give 43.
So, my equation would be:
15 + (79 - 51) = 43
Let's check: 79 - 51 equals 28 and then adding 15 gives 43.
</think>
<answer> 15 + (79 - 51) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get close to 53 using 10 and 45 together. Adding 45 and 10 gives 55, which is more than 53. Subtracting 10 from 45 gives 35, which is also not quite right. 
Now, looking at our third number, 18, it's a bit smaller but could be subtraction from 45 or addition to a smaller number to help reach 53. 
35 (45 - 10) is close to 53, and if we add 18 to 35, it equals 53. 
So, the equation using all numbers is 45 - 10 + 18 = 53. </think>
<answer> 45 - 10 + 18 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to form an equation that equals 51 using the numbers 88, 29, 63, and 3. Let's start by looking at the individual numbers and thinking about possible operations:
- One way to approach this is to test the use of subtraction, as we can subtract the smaller numbers from the larger ones.
- The number 29 seems to be a good candidate to start with as it's close to 30, which is close to 51.
- If I subtract 29 from 63, I get 34, which is closer but still not 51.
- So, let's consider adding or subtracting 88 to 34 - 17, but 88 is too large and doesn't fit. 
- Now, let's consider 34 - 88 + 29 = -35, which is not 51.
- 34 - 88 + 29 = -35, again not 51. 
- If we try 34 - 88 + 63 = 19, which is not 51.
- Now, let's consider looking at 34 and subtracting specific numbers to reach 51...
- 63 + 29 - 88 = 29 + 29 - 88 = 58 - 88 = -30.
- This is still not 51. 
- Let's try 34 - 88 + 29 = -35, not working.
- So, let's try:
- 88 - 63 + 29 - 3 = 25 + 29 - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51.
This looks promising. The equation is: 88 - 63 + 29 - 3 = 51.
</think>
<answer> 88 - 63 + 29 - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to combine the numbers 30, 19, and 16 using basic arithmetic operations to get 33. Given that 30 is close to 33, I can start considering operations that will result in this value.
I see that by subtracting 16 from 30, I will get 14. Now, to reach 33, I need to add 19 to this result. So, the equation will be (30 - 16) + 19 = 33.
</think>
<answer> (30 - 16) + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 32, 33, and 79 to create an equation that equals 14. Let's think about the operations we can use.
One useful strategy is to think about the numbers and try to form combinations that might lead to 14.
Considering the numbers 32 and 33 are close to each other and can be subtracted to get 1, and 79 is quite large but divisible by a small number, let's see if we can use 79 / 59 to get closer to 14.
If we take 79 / 5 - 33, we can see if we can adjust it to 14.
33 - 32 = 1
So 79 - 33 = 46
If we divide 46 by 3, we get 15.33, which is close to 14.
Then we need 1 less, which can be achieved by 1 - 3 = 1.
So the equation becomes (79 - 33) / 3 - 3 = 46 / 3 - 3 which equals 14.
Let's verify by calculation: (46 / 3) - 3 = (15.333...) - 3 = 12.333 - 3 = 9.333, which is not 14.
It seems we need another approach. The equation (79 / 59) - 32 = 0.7 - 32 = -31.3, which is not 14 either.
Let's try breaking 79 into 32 + 47 = 79. Then 47 - 33 = 14.
The equation: (79 - 33) - 32 = 46 - 32 = 14.
Therefore, the correct way to construct the equation is: 79 - 33 - 32 = 14.
</think>
<answer> 79 - 33 - 32 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 30 using the numbers 49, 69, and 50. I'll start by considering how these numbers can be manipulated to reach 30.
A good starting point is noticing that 50 can be manipulated in a way that relates to 30. I can subtract some number from 50 to get closer to 30.
If I subtract 20 from 50, I get 30.
Now, I need to use 49 and 69 to make 20.
Since 49 - 69 doesn't work, I'll consider multiplication or division next.
Multiplying might not work here since neither 49 nor 69 can form a simple product that results in 20.
Dividing 69 by 3 then results in 23, which is too high. Dividing 69 by 2 results in 34.5, which is also too high.
Considering subtraction or addition of 49 and 69, they need to be manipulated together to reach 20.
If I subtract 49 from 69, I get 20.
So now I have:
69 - 49 = 20
Adding this to 30 equals:
30 + 20 = 50
But I need to make 30. 
So the correct equation would be to get 20 from 50 and then add 10 to it to get 30. Since 49 - 50 = -1, I need to reverse the subtraction to addition by using the inverse operation on 49, which is addition. I can do this by adding 1 to 49, making it 50, and then subtracting it.
Therefore, the equation could be:
50 - (49 + 1)
Let's verify:
49 + 1 = 50
50 - 50 = 0
Oops, I need to correct it. It should be:
49 + 1 = 50
50 - 20 = 30
So to combine everything:
50 - (69 - 49) = 30
This will give us 50 - 20 = 30
</think>
<answer> 50 - (69 - 49) </answer>

==============
<think> First, we need to reach a value of 59 using the numbers 18, 13, and 4. Looking at the potential sum, we can start by examining what we're missing to reach 59 from the largest sum of the three numbers we have (18 + 13 + 4 = 35). We need an additional 24 to get to 59.
Now, let's consider splitting 18 and 4 in a way that allows us to get 24. We can try to use multiplication and subtraction here.
18 * 4 = 72 - 13 = 59
In this case, we subtract 13 from the result of (18 * 4) to arrive at our target number 59.
</think>
<answer> (18 * 4) - 13 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 45, 43, and 51 to get 49. 
I notice that 51 is the largest number, so it might be a good candidate to subtract or divide from to reach 49.
Let's subtract 51 from 49. This gives us -2.
Now, we need to add two numbers to get 2. 
Looking at our remaining numbers 45 and 43, we see that 45 - 43 = 2.
So, we have the equation: 51 - 45 + 43 = 49.
</think>
<answer> 51 - 45 + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to think of how I can combine 2, 21, and 80 to get 57 as the result. 
- Multiplying 80 and 7 would give me 560, which is much too high. 80 * 0. 7 would be 56, which is also out of the range.
- Dividing 560 by 10 is 56, which is still too high. 560 / 2 is 280, that's big.
- Considering the smaller numbers, two numbers can give 21 - the third one can be subtracted or added to get the answer. 
- 80 - 2 = 78. Now, I need 78 - x = 57, so x = 21. Therefore, the equation should be 80 - 2 - 21.
</think>
<answer> (80 - 2) - 21 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider how we can use the given numbers to reach 19. We can start with adding the smallest number to the largest to see if we get close enough: 9 + 11 = 20. This is close but a bit too high. If we subtract the largest number from this sum, we should be near 19: (9 + 11) - 1. This gives us 19 exactly which is what we need. Therefore, the equation is (9 + 11) - 1.
</think>
<answer>(9 + 11) - 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to combine 9 and 11 to sum up to 19. If I subtract 1 from 11, I'll get 10. Now, adding 9 to 10 gives 19. So the equation becomes: (11 - 1) + 9. However, this only uses 11 and 1, but we need to use all numbers [9, 1, 11]. 
Now, think about the structure of 19. If I add 9 to 10, and 10 is 11 - 1, I can reframe this to use the three numbers. 
So, I can start with 9 and add the result of (11 - 1), which is 10. And indeed, 9 + 10 = 19.
</think>
<answer> (9 + (11 - 1)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 36, 4, and 1 to get a result of 12. One way to approach this is to think about division since it can quickly reduce large numbers to smaller ones.
Looking at the numbers:
- 36 can be divided by 3 to get 12.
- Next, consider the number 4. It could be helpful because 4 * 3 = 12. However, we need to use 1 somewhere as well to compensate for any subtraction.
- The number 1 can be useful when subtracted from or added to 4 to achieve the result.
Given that 36 can be divided by 3 to reach our target, we need to perform 36 / 3 = 12.
However, we need to use all three numbers exactly once. We need to find a way to get 3 out of 1 and 4.
Considering 4 - 1 = 3, we've just used part of the 4 to make the division work.
Thus, the equation becomes: 36 / (4 - 1) = 12.
</think>
<answer> 36 / (4 - 1) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use 70, 63, and 40 to get 47. 
Looking at the numbers, 40 by itself is the lowest and probably not the best target.
Subtracting 40 from 70 gives 30, which is closer to 47.
Then I need to add more to get to 47. 70 - 40 = 30, and 47 - 30 = 17.
Now, 63 is the only number left, and it must be added to reach 47.
Thus, 70 - 40 + 63 = 93 - 46.
I see an error here; subtracting 46 from 93 doesn't equal 47. 
I need to reassess, using numbers in different ways.
Let's see if rearranging works, like using 63 and 70 together.
63 + 70 = 133, which is too high, but if we subtract 133 from 200, we get 67, and then subtract 10 to get 47.
But we only have 40 left.
Another way to simplify is by reducing the difference with 47.
If we try 70 - 63 = 7, we need to get to 47 from there.
Then we need to do 40 + 7, but that doesn't fit the requirement of using just the numbers once.
Another useful observation is that 63 - 40 = 23, and 70 - 23 = 47.
Now I understand that I can do it with my numbers.
Thus, the equation is 70 - (63 - 40) = 47.
</think>
<answer> 70 - (63 - 40) </answer>

==============
<think> The target number is 47. We need to use the numbers 70, 63, and 40 exactly once, each in the equation. One way to approach this is by considering subtraction and division.
First, let's subtract 40 from 70 and 63. This gives us: (70 - 40) - 63 = 30 - 63 = -33. This isn't what we want.
Next, let's try adding 70 to 40 and then subtracting 63: (70 + 40) - 63 = 110 - 63 = 47, which is exactly what we wanted.
So, the equation becomes: 70 + 40 - 63 = 47.
</think>
<answer> (70 + 40) - 63 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers: 57, 76, and 44. We need to create an expression that equals 63 using these numbers with each number being used only once.
One way to approach this is to consider if the subtraction or addition of these numbers can yield 63.
We can look if there is a way to use subtraction: 
76 - 57 = 19
This doesn't get us to 63.
Next, let's try combining 76 and 44:
76 + 44 = 120
This also doesn't give us 63.
Then, we can try different combinations using multiplication or division that could help:
76 * 44 = 3344, which is far from 63.
44 * 57 = 2488, again far from 63.
57 * 76 = 4332, which is also far from 63.
We then consider if we can use any of the numbers as a divisor:
76 ÷ 44 = 1.727, which isn't 63.
57 ÷ 44 = 1.286, which isn't 63.
The numbers 57 and 76 can't be used as divisors that would get us to 63.
Next, we can try combining 57 and 44:
57 + 44 = 101
101 - 76 = 25, which is still far from 63.
Our final check is to try with 57 and 76 as part of a more complex combination:
(76 + 57) - 44 = 133 - 44 = 89, which is still not 63.
Since no simple combination of addition, subtraction or simple multiplication and division seems to work, let’s try complex combinations with parentheses:
(76 - 57) + 44 = 19 + 44 = 63
This works as we get to 63 using all numbers.
</think>
<answer> (76 - 57) + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 84 using the numbers 85, 19, and 20. Let's start by examining what we can do with these numbers.
Given that 85 is quite close to 84, using subtraction or division with 85 might not give us the exact result of 84.
Considering the numbers 19 and 20, we can see that 20 - 19 = 1.
So, to get 84 from 85, we need to subtract some number from 85. Since we can only use the given numbers once, we'll try using 20 - 19.
That means we have: 85 - (20 - 19) which simplifies to 85 - 1.
Further simplifying, 85 - 1 equals 84.
Therefore, we can create the equation: 85 - (20 - 19) = 84.
</think>
<answer> 85 - (20 - 19) </answer>

==============
<think> We need to use the numbers 87, 20, and 39 to get 28 using basic arithmetic operations. 
First, let's consider additions and subtractions; the numbers are too small to reach 28 with simple combinations. 
Let's also consider multiplicating or dividing the numbers, but these are impossible to reach 28 directly.
Now, let's use 39 as it's the largest number. If we subtract 39 from 87, we get 48.
Next, we have 20 left, and if we subtract 48 by 20, we get 28.
Therefore, the equation is: 87 - 39 - 20.
</think>
<answer> (87 - 39) - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the given numbers (46, 75, 36, 65) and operations that result in 58. To start, I see that 75 is quite large and 36 is small, so these might be harder to use quickly. 65 is close to 58 and 46 is another single digit. 
- I notice that adding 65 and 46 gives 111, which is too high, but if I subtract 53 from this, I get 58, which is exactly what I need.  
- To get 53, I can use 75 - 36.
- 75 - 36 = 39, so 46 + (75 - 36) = 46 + 39 = 85, which is not 58. 
- However, we should re-evaluate by adjusting the operations and values. Since 46 + 39 = 85 is too high, let's try a different approach: using 75 - 36 = 39 and then finding another way to get 19 (since 58 - 19 = 39).
- Subtracting 19 from 58 can be achieved by 65 - 46 = 19.
- So, combining these ideas: 65 - 46 + (75 - 36) equals 58.
</think>
<answer> (65 - 46) + (75 - 36) </answer>

==============
<think> To create an equation that equals 38 using the numbers 7, 40, and 9 exactly once, we need to think about combinations of operations that can get us there.
One approach could be to consider if the 40 can be subtracted from another number to make a more manageable value. If we subtract 9 from 40, we get 31. Now, we need to get from 31 to 38, which could be 38 - 31 = 7.
Thus, the equation can be constructed as (40 - 9) + 7.
</think>
<answer> (40 - 9) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to think about how these numbers can add up to 35. Looking at the numbers, I see that 45 is quite close to 35. 
If I take 45 and subtract 12, I get 33, which is still too high.
If I try 45 minus 9, I get 36, which is too high.
If I try 45 minus 7, I get 38, which is also too high.
If I try 45 minus 12 and then add 9, I am getting closer to 35.
So, 45 - 12 + 9 = 42, but this is still higher than 35.
That's when I notice the correct calculation would be 45 - 12 - 7 = 26, and then adding 9 would get me 35. 
Therefore, the equation is: 45 - 12 - 7 + 9 = 35.
</think>
<answer> (45 - 12 - 7) + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 65, 93, and 67. We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 91.
We can start by looking at 93 and 67. Their difference is 93 - 67 = 26. 
Next, we have 65. Now we need to manipulate 26 to get close to 91. Adding 26 to 65 gives 91, which is exactly what we need. Therefore, the equation should be (93 - 67) + 65 = 91.
</think>
<answer>(93 - 67) + 65</answer>

==============
<think> I need to form an equation using the numbers 79, 33, and 26 that results in 72. Given we can use basic arithmetic operations and each number only once, let's think about potential operations.
- First, I notice that 79 and 33 are relatively large numbers. Perhaps subtracting 33 from 79 might work well.
- 79 - 33 = 46
- Now, I have 46 and 26. If I add 26 to 46, I get 72.
- So, the equation would be 79 - 33 + 26.
</think>
<answer> (79 - 33) + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> The target number is 86, and the available numbers are 11, 82, and 7. 
One good approach here is to try forming the equation by potentially subtracting a smaller number from a larger one using basic arithmetic.
Let's start by considering: 82 - 7 = 75, which brings us closer to our target number.
Next, we need to combine 75 with another number to reach 86.
Adding 11 to 75 yields 86.
So, the equation we need is 82 - 7 + 11 = 86.
</think>
<answer> (82 - 7) + 11 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the target number we're trying to reach: 71. The given numbers are 62, 57, and 76. 
To get close to 71, let's first subtract 76 from 71:
71 - 76 = -5
Now we need another number to arrive at this value. The only way we can do this using only the given numbers is to take 57 from 62:
62 - 57 = 5
So combining these steps:
62 - 57 - 76 + 71 = -53
Clearly this is not the solution we want, so let's rethink. Looking at the value -7 (71 - 76), we recognize 57 - 62 = -5 (57 < 62), so we can backtrack:
57 - 62 + 76 = 71
This adds up to 71 as intended, using each of the given numbers only once. </think>
<answer> (57 - 62) + 76 </answer>

==============
<think> First, we have the numbers 62, 57, and 76. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once and combining them with basic arithmetic operations to get a result of 71.
- If we subtract 76 from 62, we get -14.
- There's no combination of 57 and -14 that will give us 71.
- Now let's try adding 57 to 62, which gives us 119. This is close but still not 71.
- Next, let's try adding 62, subtracting 76 from the sum of 62 and 57. 
  - (62 + 57) - 76 = 119 - 76 = 43.
  This is still not 71.
- Now let's think if we can use 57 and 76 in a different way:
  - 76 - 57 = 19.
  - Then we need to subtract this from 62 to reach 71.
  - 62 - (76 - 57) = 62 - 19 = 43.
  - This is still far from 71.
- Given the constraints, we might need to revisit:
  - Rewriting possible combinations, we realize:
  - 57 + 76 - 62 = 133 - 62 = 71.
  - This works, as a final equation.
</think>
<answer> (57 + 76) - 62 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 76, 15, 12, and 26 that results in 47. 
One way to approach this is by trying to use addition and subtraction as these can be the quickest to combine numbers to reach a target.
Looking at the numbers, 76 seems very large and might need big subtraction from it to equal 47.
Subtracting 26 from 76 gives 50. 
Now, we have 50 - 15 = 35. 
And we need to adjust to get to 47. 
So, 35 + 12 = 47.
Thus, the equation works: 76 - 26 - 15 + 12 = 47.
</think>
<answer> (76 - 26 - 15) + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll look at the numbers we have: 42, 1, and 53. We need to create an expression using these numbers exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations to result in 12.
- One way to approach this is to see if any of the numbers can directly subtract or be subtracted from another to reach 12.
- Not 42 - 53 = -11, which is far from 12.
- 53 - 42 = 11, which is close but not exactly 12.
- Considering 53 - 42 = 11, we can add 1 (from the remaining number) to get 12. 
Thus, the equation would be 53 - 42 + 1 = 12.
</think>
<answer> (53 - 42) + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I have three numbers: 89, 41, and 38. I need to create an equation using any of the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) that results in 86. 
First, let's consider the possibility of subtraction. If I subtract 41 from 89, I get 48. Now I need 40 more to reach 86, so it seems 38 could be part of the solution.
So, 89 - 41 = 48, then I would need 86 - 48 = 38. This works, as 48 + 38 = 86.
Therefore, the equation is 89 - 41 + 38 = 86 </think>
<answer> (89 - 41) + 38 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 76, 43, and 64 that equals 55. Looking at the numbers, 76 and 64 seem like they might be useful when combined with basic arithmetic operations.
- Subtracting 64 from 76 gives me 12.
- So now I have 12 and 43 which I need to use to reach 55.
- If I take 43 and subtract it from 12, I get -31, which is too small.
- Let's try 12 + 43 which gives an equal of 55.
Therefore, 43 + 12 = 55. But I have to make 12 using 76 and 64.
- Since 76 - 64 = 12, we can make 12 that way.
So, combining these parts, we get: 76 - 64 + 43 = 55.
</think>
<answer> (76 - 64) + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination that can yield 92 using the numbers 5, 33, 12, and 42, each exactly once. One useful approach is to consider larger numbers that can be manipulated by addition or subtraction to get closer to 92.
If I take 42 and add 33, I get 75. That leaves me with 17 to reach 92.
Now, I see that 12 + 5 = 17. This fits exactly what's needed to complete the equation.
Thus, the equation that satisfies the requirements would be: 42 + 33 + 12 + 5.
</think>
<answer> (42 + 33 + 12) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 70, 7, and 15 to create an equation that equals 92. Let's start by looking at the numbers and considering what we can do with them.
- Adding 70 and 15 gives 85.
- We need an additional 7 to reach 92.
Since 85 + 7 = 92, we have found our solution. The numbers 70 and 15 can be manipulated to include the number 7 to form the equation we need.
Therefore, the equation is 70 + 15 + 7 = 92.
</think>
<answer> (70 + 15) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 13, 27, and 25 to get 65. 
First, I'll consider multiplication and addition as these can give a higher result quickly.
The number 25 might be helpful as it's close to 65, so I'll try to form that in the calculation.
One way to add 25 to the sum is by adding 13 and multiplying by 3, like this: (27 + 13) * 3 = 108, which is too big.
Another way is to form 25 by subtracting two numbers but that might not help.
Let's see 25 + a combination of 13 and 27. If I use 13 + 27 = 40, then adding 25 would equal 65.
So the equation would be: 25 + (13 + 27) = 65.
</think>
<answer> 25 + (13 + 27) </answer>

==============
<think> Firstly, I need to find a combination of the numbers 65, 42, and 29 that, when combined using basic arithmetic operations, equals 52. Let's start by trying some operations:
- If I subtract 29 from 42, I get 13. Then the equation looks like: (65 - 42) + 29 = 52.
- Now I'll check if (65 - 42) + 29 equals 52: 
  65 - 42 = 23
  23 + 29 = 52
Thus, the equation is correct.
</think>
<answer> (65 - 42) + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I need to get as close to 71 as possible using the numbers 80, 9, 3, and 21. 
Adding 80 and 9 gives 89, which is too high.
Subtracting the numbers from 80, 9, 3, and 21 directly does not reach 71.
If I subtract 21 from 80, I get 59.
Adding 9 and 3 to this gives 59 + 9 + 3 = 71.
So the equation I'm building is: (80 - 21) + (9 + 3).
</think> 
<answer>(80 - 21) + (9 + 3)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to figure out how to combine the numbers 88, 18, and 41 to get 29. 
- 88 and 18 can be used in some combination to subtract, add, or multiply, but 41 seems less likely as it's quite far from 29.
- Now, considering the numbers, one possibility is to use 88 - 18 and then subtract this result from 41.
- Let's perform the operations: 88 - 18 = 70.
- Now, subtract this from 41: 41 - 70 = -29.
- However, -29 doesn't equal 29.
- Another approach could be dividing 88 by 41, which isn't going to give us an integer, and we can't use the remainder to get to 29.
- The next possibility is to take the combination that is very close to 29, i.e., 41 - 18 = 23, and then subtracting from it again by 41 - 23 = 18. But this also doesn't give us 29.
- However, if we consider 88 - 18 = 70, then 70 - 41 = 29, it seems we have a valid equation.
</think>
<answer> (88 - 18) - 41 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the basic arithmetic operations and how combining them might result in 44 using the numbers 46, 40, and 42.
- If I subtract 42 from 46, I get 4 (i.e., 46 - 42 = 4).
- Then, if I add 4 to 40, I get 44 (i.e., 40 + 4 = 44).
So, the equation can be formed by first subtracting 42 from 46 and then adding the result to 40.
The equation is (46 - 42) + 40 = 44.
</think>
<answer> (46 - 42) + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to come up with an equation that uses the numbers 16, 11, and 86, which equals 59. I should start by looking at the operations and how they can balance out the numbers.
I see that 86 is quite large, so subtraction or division involving it would skew the result too much. Multiplying by 11 would also be a large increase from 16 or 11.
Then, I notice that 86 - 11 = 75, which is pretty close to 59. If I subtract a smaller number, 16 from 59, I would get 43. This is closer to 75, which I can achieve by further reduction.
So, 59 = 75 - 16. But 75 can be derived by 86 - 11. Therefore, 59 = (86 - 11) - 16.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 11) - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll examine the numbers given: 17, 24, and 60. I need to use each of these exactly once and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 67.
Let's start by looking at the target number 67 and the other numbers:
- We can't directly get 67 by just adding or subtracting 17, 24, and 60.
- Multiplying 60 by integers won't give us 67 since it would be too large.
- Dividing 60 by integers won't work either.
Now, if we use addition and subtraction:
- We could try 60 + 24 + 17, but that equals 101, which is too high.
- Or 60 + 24 - 17, but that only equals 67, which is exactly what we need!
Since 60 + 24 - 17 equals 67, this combination works.
</think>
<answer> (60 + 24) - 17 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find an equation that results in 29 using the numbers 28, 92, and 91. 
Looking at the numbers, 92 - 91 = 1, which is quite close to 29. 
Next, to reach 29, I can add the difference between 29 and 1 to 92 - 91. 
29 - 1 = 28. 
So, 28 + (92 - 91) = 28 + 1 = 29.
Therefore, the equation is (92 - 91) + 28 = 29.
</think>
<answer>(92 - 91) + 28</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get close to 54 using the numbers 62, 2, and 6. 
Considering 62 is quite large, subtracting or dividing by it may overshoot 54. 
Using the number 6, if I subtract it from 62, I get 56. 
Now, with 56 and 2, 56 - 2 = 54. 
So, the equation using the numbers 62, 2, and 6 should be: 62 - 6 - 2 = 54.
</think>
<answer> (62 - 6) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the operations I can use and the numbers available. To get a result of 13, I can try combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Using division: If I divide 98 by 7, I get 14, which is close but not quite 13.
- Using subtraction: If I subtract 58 from 98, I get 40. Now, I need to manipulate 27 to get to the number -17 (because 40 - 17 = 23, which is less than 13, and 23 - 34 = -11, which is closer, but I need 13).
- I can use 27 - 58 = -31, but I need to change this to fit 13.
- If I try 98 - 58 - 27, I will get 98 - 85 = 13.
So, the equation is 98 - 58 - 27 = 13.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 58 - 27)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that uses 98, 27, and 58 that equals 13. One approach is to reduce 98 and 58 to their basic components and then combine them with 27 to form 13.
Let's start with 98 - 58 = 40.
Now we have 40 - 27 = 13.
Hence, our equation is 98 - 58 - 27 = 13.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 58) - 27 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the given numbers 98, 27, and 58 to get 13 as the result. Let's look at the operations we can use: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division).
First, 13 is a relatively small number compared to the numbers we have, so subtraction or division might be more useful.
98 is the largest number and could potentially be the result after subtraction. Trying 98 - 58 = 40 doesn't work.
27 is a good candidate for division as it's smaller than both the other numbers. Let's check if 58 / 27 = 2.148... which is not 13, so that won't work.
Now, let's consider multiplication as it could potentially yield a larger number that could be reduced by 27. Multiplying 98 * 27 = 2646, which is too big.
Finally, I'll try two subtraction operations:
98 - 58 = 40 - 27 = 13.
This gives us the equation 98 - 58 - 27 = 13.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 58 - 27)</answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider what operations and numbers could potentially lead to 98 using the provided numbers (29, 94, 25).
94 is quite close to 98, so subtracting 25 from 94 gives us 69.
Adding 29 to 69 gives us 98.
So, the operations we can use are subtraction and addition.
The equation can be constructed as: 94 - 25 + 29 = 98.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 25) + 29 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the target number we're aiming for, which is 51. 
We have numbers: 35, 5, and 44. 
Looking at these numbers, 44 seems to put us close to 51. 
Subtracting 44 from 51 leaves us with 7.
Now, we need to get the number 7 using the remaining numbers 35 and 5.
Since 35 divided by 5 equals 7, we can achieve our target.
So the equation would be:
(35 / 5) + 44 = 7 + 44 = 51.
</think>
<answer> (35 / 5) + 44 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 91, 49, and 67. We need to reach 73 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try to see if we can subtract or add some numbers to hit close to 73.
- If we subtract 49 from 91, we get 42.
- Then, if we add 67 to 42, we get 109, which is far from 73.
- Alternatively, let's try adding 49 to 67 and then subtracting 91:
  - Adding 49 and 67 gives us 116.
  - Subtracting 91 from 116 leaves us with 25, which is still not 73.
- Another attempt: Adding 67 to 49 gives us 116.
  - Now if we add 116 to 91 we get 207, which is too large.
- Let's try multiplying 67 by 1 and then add 49 and 91:
  - 67 * 1 = 67.
  - Then 67 + 49 + 91 = 207, which is too large again.
- Looking for a different approach: Subtracting 91 from 67 and then adding 14 seems promising, but 14 is not present.
- Finally, let's consider 91 - 49 - 67 + 73 - 73. This looks complex.
- Instead, if we consider 91 - (49 + 67) + 14, we get:
  - (49 + 67) = 116.
  - 91 - 116 = -25.
  - -25 + 14 = -11 (Not 73).
- A simpler approach seems to be: (91 - 67) + 49 / 1 = 24 + 49 / 1 =
  - 49 / 1 = 49.
  - 91 - 67 + 49 = 73.
So, the correct equation that equals 73 is (91 - 67) + 49.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 67) + 49 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to approach the equation 76 using the numbers 5, 3, and 27. 
Looking at the numbers, 27 seems like a good candidate to be raised to a power or combined with another number to get closer to 76. 
Multiplying 3 by 27 gives us 81, which is close but too high.
Dividing 27 by 3 gives us 9. 
If we then multiply 5 by 9, we get 45, which is low but helpful.
To reach 76 from 45, we need 31, so we need to get 31 from using 5 and 9. 
Adding 5 and 9 gives us 14. 
Now we need 17 more, and we can get 17 by subtracting 9 from 27.
So, our equation would be: (5 + 9) * (27 - 3) = 45 * 24 = 1080 / 20 = 76.
However, my mistake was ignoring the order of operations and the constraint of using each number only once. 
Instead, using the numbers and operations provided more effectively, the correct approach would be to realize we can directly multiply 3 by 27 to get 81 and then subtract 5 from 81 to aim for 76.
81 - 5 = 76.
</think>
<answer> 27 * 3 - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 32, 31, and 91 exactly once to get 92. 
The number 92 is close to 91, so let's consider subtracting one of the numbers and adding another.
If I subtract 91 from 92, I get 1. 
Now I need to get 1 from 32 and 31 using basic arithmetic operations.
I can subtract 31 from 32 to get 1.
So the equation becomes: 32 - 31 + 92 - 91 = 92.
However, I need to use each number only once, and the above equation uses all three numbers but in a different order.
The correct equation that uses each number exactly once and equals 92 is: 32 - 31 + 91.
Now, let's verify: 32 - 31 = 1, then 1 + 91 = 92.
</think>
<answer> (32 - 31) + 91 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 45 using the numbers 2, 94, and 51 exactly once. 
Let's start by looking at what I can do with 51 and 94. Subtracting 51 from 94 gives me 43. So, now I have 2 and 43.
I need to get to 45, so I can use 2 + 43 = 45, but since that would involve using 43 again which isn't allowed, I need another way to get 45.
If I add 2 to 43, I get 45, which is precisely what I need. 
Thus, the equation is 2 + (94 - 51) = 45.
</think>
<answer> (2 + (94 - 51)) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll consider the target we want to reach which is 45. I can try adding and subtracting the numbers in different combinations.
2 + 94 = 96 (which is too big)
94 - 51 = 43 (which is close but slightly too small)
If I subtract 51 from 94 first, I get 43. Then, to reach 45, I need to add 2 to 43.
So, the equation becomes: 94 - 51 + 2 = 45.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 51) + 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider how we can combine the numbers to reach 75.
We have the numbers: 32, 51, 6, 50.
If we use 51 as it is, we need to reach 24 from the remaining numbers (32, 6, 50).
50 - 32 = 18, which brings us closer to 24.
18 + 6 = 24.
Now, we have 51 + 24 = 75.
So the equation should be 51 + (50 - 32 + 6).
</think>
<answer> 51 + (50 - 32 + 6) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's list the numbers we have: 66, 10, 3, and 14. We need to create an equation using these numbers once only and the operations +, -, *, / to get 45.
One approach could be to use subtraction and addition to get close to 45. Looking at the numbers, 66 - 10 = 56 seems close to 45 but a bit too high. Let's try to balance this with other numbers.
Now, observe that 66 - 10 = 56 and 56 - 3 = 53, and 53 - 8 = 45. We are just short by 8.
But we need to use all the numbers once. If we consider 14 + 3 = 17, we can use this to balance our equation.
So, let's use: 66 - 10 - 14 + 3 = 45.
</think>
<answer> (66 - 10 - 14) + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 25, 97, and 34 that can be manipulated using basic arithmetic operations to equal 88. 
97 is the largest number and could potentially serve as a base. Let's start by subtracting 34 from 97:
97 - 34 = 63
Now, 63 is much closer to our target but is still above it. To reduce from 63 to 88, we need to add some value. The remaining number is 25, which is close to the difference needed. 
63 + 25 = 88
Therefore, the equation is:
(97 - 34) + 25 = 88
</think>
<answer>(97 - 34) + 25</answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers [92, 54, 31, 42] to create an equation that equals 49 using basic arithmetic operations. One approach is to try different combinations of these numbers with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Starting with a basic combination, let's subtract 42 from 92, which gives us 50. Then, we can subtract 31 from this result to get 19. Finally, subtracting 54 from 19 won't get us to 49, so we need to consider other combinations.
Another possibility is to try multiplication and addition. 42 * 1.25 = 52.5. Subtracting 31 and 54 from 92. This doesn't work either. 
Considering division, if we divide 54 by 1.25, we get 43.2. Adding 92 and subtracting 43.2 from this gives us 48.8, which is close but not 49.
Lastly, let's try: 42 + 92 - 31 gives us 103. Now, I need to get from 103 to 49 by using 54. If I subtract 54 from 103, I get 49.
So the equation will be 42 + 92 - 31 - 54 = 49.
</think>
<answer> (42 + 92 - 31) - 54 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 59, 24, and 53 to make 88. Let's start by looking at the numbers and the gap between them.
59 is the largest, and 88 is 29 more than 59. 
24 could be useful if we subtract it from a bigger number.
53 is the second largest, and 88 - 53 = 35. 
So, we need something that results in 35 when subtracted from 59.
59 - 24 = 35. 
Therefore, we can use 59 - 24 + 53 = 88.
</think>
<answer> (59 - 24) + 53 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's look at the numbers we have: 7, 89, and 67. We need to create an equation that equals 29 using each of these numbers exactly once.
We can try different combinations of basic arithmetic operations. One approach is to start with the largest number, 89, and see if we can get a result close to 29 by subtracting or adding smaller numbers.
89 - 67 = 22
22 - 7 = 15
15 is still not 29, but if we try adding 7 to 15, we get:
22 - 67 + 7 = 29
So the equation becomes:
89 - 67 + 7 = 29
</think>
<answer> (89 - 67) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to get close to 79 using the numbers 19, 40, 3, and 97. Let's start by considering some possible operations.
Multiplying 97 by 1 (which doesn't change anything) and then adding 3 and 19 doesn't work as it would give 100, which is too high.
Then, I notice that 97 is quite large. Let's try to use subtraction. If we subtract 40 from 97, we get 57. Now, we need 22 more to reach 79: 57 - 40 = 17, and 79 - 17 = 62, which is still above our target.
19 + 3 = 22, which is exactly what we need to reach 79. So our equation is 97 - 40 + 19 + 3 = 79.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 40) + 19 + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I'll look for a way to combine the numbers to get close to 79. The number 97 is quite large and the number 19 is relatively small, so I should consider how to use them. 40 and 3 are the remaining numbers which can be combined.
Now let's consider the target number, 79. If I subtract 3 from 97, I get 94, which is close to 79. However, subtracting 3 from 97 might not yield a result that, when used with 19 or 40, equals 79.
Let's try combining 40 and 3 first. 40 - 3 = 37. Now I have 37 and 19. I need to get to 79, and this means adding something to 37 + 19 to equal 79. Let's see, 37 + 19 = 56, and we need 23 more to reach 79. The remaining number is 19, and dividing 19 by 37 will give me a small fraction, which isn't useful, and I'm already using 19. 
By trying other combinations, I see that if I rearrange the numbers and operations, I can use 40 - (3 + 19/37) should work where 37 is in the denominator, though I'm not sure if this follows the rule strictly. But looking at the straightforward calculation:
97 - 40 = 57
57 - 19 = 38
To reach 79, we need to add 41, but directly reaching 79 from 38 using only one more step is tricky with given numbers. So let's reconsider:
97 - 40 = 57
19 * 3 = 57
This doesn't give us 79 either, so let's try:
97 - 40 = 57
57 - 19 = 38
38 + 41 = 79 (But we need 41 with just the remaining numbers)
The correct way without fractional steps directly:
(97 - 40) + (19 + 3) = 57 + 22 = 79
This fits and uses all numbers only once. 
</think>
<answer> (97 - 40) + (19 + 3) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 51, 5, and 35 to get to 81. 
Looking at the numbers, 51 is quite large and 35 is also significant, so subtracting or adding 51 or 35 won't likely get us 81. 
Considering multiplication, 51 * 5 = 255, which is too large, and 35 * 5 = 175, which is also too large.
Considering division, 51 is not divisible by 5 or 35.
The only arithmetic operation left to consider is subtraction. 
If I subtract 5 from 51 I get 46, which, when added to 35, equals 81.
51 - 5 = 46
46 + 35 = 81
Therefore, the equation is 51 - 5 + 35 = 81.
</think>
<answer> (51 - 5) + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 91, 12, and 54. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once that equals 49.
One possible approach could be to use subtraction to reduce 91 to a smaller number, and then use the other numbers to get 49.
91 - 12 = 79
Now, we need another number to subtract from 79 to get 49.
79 - 54 = 25
We now have the equation 91 - 12 - 54 = 25, but we need 49. 
To get from 25 to 49, we can add another number, which means we need to find a way to get 24 from 91, 12, or 54.
If we take 91 - 54 = 37, then 37 - 25 = 12.
But we need to reach 49. We can try to use the remaining numbers and operations.
Let's subtract 12 from 54 and then subtract the resulting from 79. 
54 - 12 = 42
79 - 42 = 37
This doesn't work directly, but we notice that 79 - 37 = 42 and 42 - 12 = 30. We haven't used 91 yet.
We can try another combination: if we take 91 - 54 = 37, then 37 + 12 = 49.
Therefore, the equation is 91 - 54 + 12 = 49.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 54) + 12 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 3, 83, and 42 that equals 44. Let's start by looking at the numbers and considering what basic arithmetic operations could be used.
Given the numbers, subtraction seems promising because it can change the value of a number in a way that allows incrementing or decrementing to reach the target.
Considering 83 as the larger number, subtracting 42 might bring us closer to 44, and then subtracting 3 from the result would equally straightforward.
So, let's do the math: 83 - 42 = 41. Then, 41 - 3 = 38. However, 38 is not our target (44).
Given 42 is larger than 3 and 83, subtracting 42 from 83 would give 41 and we need to get to 44. So, we need to add a value to 41 to reach 44. That value would be 3, as 41 + 3 = 44.
Therefore, the equation would be 83 - 42 + 3 = 44.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 42) + 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 80, 66, and 71. We need to arrive at the number 75 using these numbers and basic arithmetic operations. 
Notice that 80 + 66 = 146 and 146 - 71 = 75.
So, we can create the equation: 80 + 66 - 71 = 75.
</think>
<answer> (80 + 66) - 71 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers 77 and 95. If we subtract 77 from 95, we get 18. 
Now we have two numbers: 18 and 81. To reach 63, we need to subtract 18 from 81. 
So, the equation becomes: 81 - 18 = 63.
Therefore, the equation using the numbers 77, 95, and 81 is 81 - (95 - 77).
</think>
<answer> 81 - (95 - 77) </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 95, 35, and 82 that equals 48. I'll start by looking at the numbers and trying different combinations with the basic arithmetic operations.
95 + 35 = 130
This is too high, so we can eliminate this.
95 - 35 = 60
This is too high as well.
95 - 82 = 13
This is close but not quite right.
Let's try using the other operations. If we take 95 * 35, we will get a very large number.
95 * 35 = 3325
Again, this is much too high.
If we compute 35 * 82, we get:
35 * 82 = 2870
This is also too large.
We notice that 95 - 35 - 82 does not equal 48.
95 - 35 - 82 = -2
We need a positive result. Let's try rearranging the operations:
Using (95 - 82) + 35:
95 - 82 = 13
13 + 35 = 48
So, (95 - 82) + 35 equals 48.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 82) + 35 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 74, 66, 17, and 60 that equals 85. I'll start by looking at the larger and smaller numbers to see if there's any immediate combination. 

- 74 + 17 = 91 (too high)
- 74 - 17 = 57 (too low)
- 66 + 17 = 83 (too high)
- 66 + 60 = 126 (too high)
- 74 + 60 = 134 (too high)
- 66 + 17 + 60 = 143 (too high)

It seems adding these directly isn't working. Let me try combining different pairs and adding or subtracting the remaining number.

- 66 - 17 = 49 (better)
- 49 + 74 = 123 (too high)
- 49 + 60 = 109 (too high)
- 49 + 17 = 66 (not include 66)
- 66 - 17 + 17 = 66 (not need to use 17 again)
- 49 + 74 - 17 = 106 (too high)
- 49 - 17 + 66 = 98 (too high)
- 49 + 17 + 60 = 126 (too high)
- 74 - 66 = 8 (not enough to get to 85)
- 66 + 17 - 60 = 23 (not enough)

Finally, let me check another possible combination:

- 74 + 17 - 60 = 31 (too low)
- 74 + 60 - 17 = 117 (too high)
- 66 + 17 = 83 (too high)
- 60 + 17 = 77 (too low)
- 66 - 17 + 74 = 123 (too high)
- 66 + 74 - 17 = 123 (too high)
- 60 + 17 - 66 = 11 (too low)
- 60 + 74 - 66 = 70 (too low)
- 66 - 17 + 74 = 123 (too high)
- 60 + 74 - 17 = 117 (too high)

I realize I need to use all the numbers only once. Checking for all permutations quickly:

- 66 + 17 - 74 = 11 (too low)
- 66 + 74 - 17 = 123 (too high)
- 74 + 17 - 66 = 25 (too low)
- 74 + 60 - 17 = 117 (too high)
- 66 + 17 + 60 = 143 (too high)
- 66 + 74 - 17 = 123 (too high)

Finally, I get this:
- 74 + 60 + 17 - 66 = 85
</think>
<answer> (74 + 60 + 17) - 66 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a way to create 22 using the numbers 14, 41, and 77 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
Considering the numbers, 77 is the largest and could potentially be used as a divisor or in subtraction to get to 22. If I subtract 77 from 41, I get -36, which is not helpful.
Next, let's try adding 14 to 41. That gives me 55, which is close but still too high.
If I divide 41 by 14, I get approximately 2.93, which is not an integer and not close to 22.
Now, let's think of multiplication. Multiplying 14 by 2 gives 28, again not 22.
Considering these failed attempts, let's think if there's another path. If I subtract 14 from 41, I get 27. From here, if I then subtract 77, it seems too negative.
Let's try one last scenario: Adding 14 to itself (which is 28) and then subtracting 77. That gives -45, still not 22.
I've tried various combinations of operations and haven't found a solution. However, looking back, I realized I misinterpreted earlier.
If I reevaluate subtracting 14 from 41, we have 27, and if we then divide 27 by 14, we get approximately 1.93, and from here subtract 77 doesn't seem promising.
But if I think of combining 14 and 41 first: 14 + 41 = 55, and if we then subtract this from 77, we get 22, which is 22.
So, 77 - (14 + 41) = 22.
</think>
<answer> 77 - (14 + 41) </answer>

==============
<think> I'll first consider how to combine these numbers to reach 54. I'll start by checking if any straightforward combination with the given numbers can produce 54, focusing on multiplication and addition since 92 is a large number.
1/ First, 92 is much larger than 54. Dividing 92 by any of the other numbers won't yield a reasonable integer result.
2/ If I multiply 35 by any number in [3, 92], I'd need a large multiplier like 16 to reach or exceed 54, but that's not possible with the available numbers.
3/ Now, let's see what happens if we add or subtract the numbers compared to their individual values:
- Adding 35 and 3: 35 + 3 = 38, which is still too low.
- Subtracting 3 from 35: 35 - 3 = 32, which is even lower.
- Adding 3 to 92: 92 + 3 = 95, which is too high.
4/ After trying various combinations, I noticed that 35 - 92 + something should give us 54. But 35 - 92 = -57, which is far from 54.
5/ If I subtract 3 from 92: 92 - 3 = 89, and then I need to make this 54 by adding something. But that's not possible without exceeding 54.
6/ Upon re-evaluating, I realized the key here is to use 35 and 92 in a combination that significantly changes the result, like multiplication and then addition or subtraction.
7/ Now, let's consider the multiplication: 35 * 3 = 105. Subtracting this from 92 gives us: 92 - 105 = -13.
8/ However, this doesn't help. The idea seems not aligned here as the numbers are inverted.
9/ But if I reassess, 35 - 3 = 32 and then 92 - 32 = 60. That isn't helping either.
10/ This leaves 35 itself as a candidate. So, 35 - (92 - 3) = 35 - 89 = -54, which isn't correct.
11/ Considering the absolute necessity of 54, we recognize the equation 35 + 18 = 53 is close but needs to be adjusted.
12/ Rechecking:
    - 35 + 92 - 35 = 92, which is too high.
    - 35 + 35 - 82 = -2, which is too low.
13/ Rechecking 92 - 35 and then 35: 92 - 35 = 57, I need -3 to reach 54.
14/ The only combination that fits using 39 (92 - 35) as 54 - 57 = -3 is invalid, leading us back to the initial direct subtraction -3 being the only solution that matches the 3, 92, 35.
</think>
<answer> (92 - 35) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 59, 42, and 44. We need to create an equation that equals 61 using each number only once and the basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the differences between the numbers:
- 59 - 44 = 15
- 59 - 42 = 17
- 44 - 42 = 2
None of these differences directly help us get to 61.
We can also try combinations with addition and subtraction:
59 - 42 + 44 = 59 + 4 + 44 = 61
This adds up the numbers 59 and 44 and then subtracts 42 to get 61.
</think>
<answer> (59 + 44) - 42 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to use the numbers 92, 89, and 31 to create an equation that equals 28. I notice that 92 - 89 = 3, which is quite close to 31 but not quite enough.
If I use 31 - 89 + 92, I get:
31 - 89 = -58
-58 + 92 = 34
This is too high.
Given that basic arithmetic doesn't easily add up to 28 with these numbers, I'll try a different approach. I think I should subtract 31 from 92 and then take the result and subtract 89, which gives:
92 - 31 = 61
61 - 89 = -28
Since I want a positive 28, I can reverse the signs and get:
(61 - 89) = -28
So, I need to make a positive 28. I recall I might need to add 89 and subtract 92, but it won't work that way.
At this point, it seems straightforward to see I could do:
89 - 31 = 58, which is too much
92 - 89 = 3
So, by combining these, we get:
92 - (31 - 89) = 92 - (-58) = 92 + 58 = 150, which is too big.
Instead, let's reconfigure:
89 + (92 - 31) = 89 + 61 = 150, which is also too big.
Finally, combining the numbers in a different manner:
89 - (92 - 31) = 89 - 61 = 28
This gives us the desired result of 28.
</think>
<answer> 89 - (92 - 31) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 12, 34, and 25 that can be used with basic arithmetic operations to equal 71. One effective way to approach this is to see if any numbers can be combined to reach a value close to 71.
Considering the numbers, 34 is a significant component as 34 + 37 equals 71. This suggests we need to combine 12 and 25 to get 37. The only operation that can do this is addition, as 12 + 25 = 37.
Therefore, the equation is: 34 + (12 + 25) = 71.
</think>
<answer> 34 + (12 + 25) </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 30 using the numbers 3, 96, and 2. 
Looking at the numbers, we see that 96 is quite large and 2 is small. So, these two might be involved in a division or multiplication to make 96 manageable.
If I divide 96 by 3, I get 32, which is close to 30. Now, to make it exactly 30, I can subtract 2 from 32.
So, the equation becomes: (96 / 3) - 2 = 30.
</think>
<answer> (96 / 3) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 48 using the numbers 47, 46, and 47. 
Looking at the numbers, it seems I can use subtraction and addition to get to 48. 
Starting with 47 + 47 = 94. 
Now, I need to get from 94 to 48. 
So, 94 - 46 = 48.
Therefore, the equation using the numbers 47, 46, 47 to get 48 is: (47 + 47) - 46 = 48.
</think>
<answer> (47 + 47) - 46 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 24, 4, and 16. We need to create an expression that equals 80 using these numbers only once.
One way to approach this is to try to combine the numbers in a way that one of them can be used to reach the target number more easily. 
If we multiply 24 by 4, we get:
24 * 4 = 96
This is close to our target of 80, but a bit high. 
Now let's look at 16 and see if we can use it to adjust this result:
96 - 16 = 80
Thus, we have 96 - 16 = 80.
</think>
<answer> (24 * 4) - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 29, 1, and 42 that equals 14. Given that 42 is much larger than 14, it seems impossible to reach 14 just by addition or multiplication with 42.
29 is also too large. Subtracting 29 from 42 does not get us close enough to 14 either.
Considering the goal is to use all numbers exactly once, I'll look at what 1 can do. If I use 1, multiplication by it can quickly help bring numbers down to a manageable size.
If I use 1 with 29, 1 * 29 = 29, which is still too large.
If I use 1 with 42, 1 * 42 = 42, which is also too large.
Considering division, I think about what else I can pair with 1. 1 * 14 = 14, so if I can get 14 using 29 and 42, that might work.
Given that 29 - 42 = -13, which is not helpful, I need to divide, and adding 1 to make it positive could work.
So, we could consider 42 - 29 = 13, and then add 1 more to get 14.
Hence, the equation would be (42 - 29) + 1 = 14.
</think>
<answer>(42 - 29) + 1</answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 76 using the numbers 16, 46, and 46. 
I observe that 46 + 46 is 92, which is too high. 
Subtracting 16 from 92 gives me 76, which is exactly what I need.
So the equation can be 46 + 46 - 16 = 76.
</think>
<answer> (46 + 46) - 16 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 93, 40, and 9. We need to create an equation that equals 44 using these numbers exactly once.
One approach could be to subtract 93 and 40 to get a negative number, and then use that with 9.
Let's calculate: 93 - 40 = 53
Now we have 53 and 9. Subtracting 53 and 9 gives: 53 - 9 = 44
So, our equation is: 53 - 9 = 44
Since we cannot use the number 93 and 40 at the same place in the equation, we should re-evaluate. Let me switch the order to first subtract 9 from 93, then subtract that result from 40.
So, first: 93 - 9 = 84
Then: 84 - 40 = 44
This gives us the equation: (93 - 9) - 40 = 44
But we only used 93 and 9 as part of this. To use 40 and 9 correctly without repeating, let's break it down slightly differently.
Using the original numbers, let's subtract 40 from 93, which gives: 93 - 40 = 53.
Now, we have 53 and 9. We can add these together: 53 + 9 = 62.
This doesn't work either, so let's revert to the original setup and adjust:
We know (93 - 40) should equal 53. Then 53 + 9 = 62 isn't correct. Let's try another way:
Using 93 - 40 = 53 and then subtracting 53 from 90 (which is 40+90-93) gives us:
90 - 53 = 37. This doesn't help.
We need to try another structure:
(93 - 40) - (9) = 53 - 9 = 44. This is valid.
So, we get the correct equation as: (93 - 40) - 9 = 44.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 40) - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to create an equation using the numbers 2, 75, and 8 that equals 65. 
First, I notice that 75 is quite far from 65, and the difference could be helped by subtracting from it. 
Using 8, I can potentially reduce the number without making it too small. 
Then, I see that 2 can be helpful as a small number to add or subtract.
If I use 75 - 8 = 67, and then subtract 2 from 67, I get 65.
The equation would look like: (75 - 8) - 2 = 65.
This meets the criteria of using each number only once and resulting in 65.
</think>
<answer> (75 - 8) - 2 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 88 using the numbers 84, 61, and 57 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations. 
I notice that 84 - 61 = 23, which is close to 88. 
So, to reach 88, I need 65 more. 
Now, 84 - 61 + 57 is already 80. 
Unfortunately, 80 does not equal 88. 
Let's try another combination. 
Trying 57 - 61 = -4, and adding 84 gives me 80. 
I need 8 more to make 88. 
So, 84 + 8 = 92. 
This is too high. 
Let's try subtracting instead of adding: 
57 - 61 = -4, then subtracting 84 from it gives -127. 
This is clearly incorrect. 
Next, let's try another approach: 
84 - 57 = 27. 
27 + 61 = 88. 
This gives us the desired result. 
So, the equation is 84 - 57 + 61 = 88. </think>
<answer> (84 - 57) + 61 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 82, 31, and 54 exactly once to get 59. 
First, let's consider the large number 82. If we subtract 54 from 82, we get 28.
So, 82 - 54 = 28.
Now we need an additional 31 to reach 59. We already have 28, so we need 31 - 28 = 3.
Thus, our equation should be 82 - 54 + 31, which simplifies to 59.
</think>
<answer> (82 - 54) + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's examine the numbers we have: 1, 35, 80, 84. We want to form an equation that equals 40. 
Looking at the numbers, 84 - 80 = 4 is a small step that gets us close to our target.
Now, we need 36 more to reach 40. 
We can get 36 from the combination of 35 + 1.
So, the equation would be 84 - 80 + (35 + 1) = 40.
</think>
<answer> (84 - 80) + (35 + 1) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider what we need to get to 79 using the numbers 41, 61, and 99 exactly once, with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
We can start by looking at the differences between the numbers:
99 - 61 = 38
41 - 38 = 3
If we use 61 - 38 + 41, we get:
61 - 38 = 23
23 + 41 = 64
This doesn't quite give us 79, but we can try a different combination.
Another approach could involve multiplication and addition:
99 * 1 = 99
41 + (99 - 61) = 41 + 38 = 79
99 * 1 + (41 - 61) = 99 + (-10) = 89
99 + 1*(41-61) = 99 - 20 = 79
Considering this last combination, we use 99 + (41 - 61).
</think>
<answer> 99 + 41 - 61 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to create an equation that equals 22 using the numbers 78, 95, and 5. Let's try to use subtraction and division.
1. 95 - 78 = 17
2. Then, we need 5 more to reach 22. So, we perform 17 / 5 = 3.4
3. However, 3.4 is not an integer and using division like this doesn't result in 22.
4. Next, let's try subtracting 5 from 95 and then dividing by 78.
   95 - 5 = 90
   90 / 78 is approximately 1.15, which is not 22.
5. Then, let's subtract 78 from 95 and see what happens.
   95 - 78 = 17
   Now, if we can achieve 22 by adding 5 to 17, it's a possibility.
6. Adding 5 to 17 gives 22.
Therefore, the equation is 95 - 78 + 5 = 22.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 78) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers and possible operations. We need to combine 78, 95, and 5 to get 22. 
One approach would be to think of subtracting smaller numbers from larger ones.
If we use 5 as our base number, subtracting it from 78 gives us 73.
Next, if we subtract this result from 95, we get 22.
So the equation would be: 
95 - (78 - 5) = 22
</think>
<answer> 95 - (78 - 5) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 26, 57, and 97. We need to create an equation that equals 66 using basic arithmetic operations and each number only once.
- Start with the numbers in mind and think about combinations of operations that might get us closer to 66.
- If we subtract 26 from 57, we get 31. Now we need 35 more to reach 66.
- To get 35, we can add 26 to 97, but using 97 twice isn't allowed.
- This combination looks promising: 57 - 26 + 97.
- But when we calculate this, we get 57 - 26 + 97 = 31 + 97 = 128, which is not 66.
- Now consider another way: 97 - 57 + 26.
- When we calculate this, we get 97 - 57 + 26 = 40 + 26 = 66.
- This works, and each number is used only once.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 57) + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to find an equation that uses the numbers 27, 77, and 63 only once to equal 41. 
Notice that 77 - 63 = 14, which is close to 41 but not quite there.
If I use 27, the remaining number is 63. If I add these two, I get 27 + 63 = 90, which is too large.
Now, I should consider using division to adjust the total. If I subtract 77 from 27, I get -50, which is not desirable.
Since adding and subtracting seems to be taking me in the wrong direction towards 41, I need to try multiplication or division.
Multiplying 27 and 63 gives 1701, which when divided by 77 gives a very large result (22. 064), also not useful.
Since none of the direct operations are yielding a result of 41, let's reconsider how these numbers can be combined.
If we consider (77 - 63) = 14, and then try to get to 41 with the remaining 27, we can see:
(77 - 63) + 27 = 14 + 27 = 41.
This gives us the result we need directly, without needing any further division or multiplication.
</think>
<answer> (77 - 63) + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 27, 77, and 63. We need to create an equation that equals 41 using each of these numbers exactly once.
One approach is to think about subtraction and addition:
- 77 - 63 = 14
This gives us 14, which is not 41. We need to use the other number too.
Let's try adding 27 to our result:
- (77 - 63) + 27 = 14 + 27 = 41
This works because 14 + 27 equals 41.
</think>
<answer> (77 - 63) + 27 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get as close as possible to 51 using the numbers 34, 30, and 47. If I add 30 and 47, I get 77. Now, I need 24 less to reach 51 (because 51 + 24 = 75). The number 24 can be formed by the difference between 34 and 30 (34 - 30 = 4). So, to get 24, I need to add 20, but I don't have 20 either. The only way to get 20 using the numbers is 4 * 5, but 5 is not given. However, 47 - 34 = 13, and 30 - 13 = 17, which doesn't help. The best I can do is to subtract 9, and 9 is 47 - 38. Since I don't have 38, I can't directly achieve 24 in this way.
Another way to look at it is to consider adding and subtracting in a different order. If I take 34 - 30 = 4, and then add 47 = 51, that works. Let's check: 47 + (34 - 30) = 51.
</think>
<answer> (34 - 30) + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> First, I need to get as close to 32 as possible using the numbers 12, 24, and 20. 
If I use 24 as it is and combine it with other numbers to get close to 8 (since 24 + 8 = 32), I can look at the remaining numbers, 12 and 20.
12 - 20 = -8, which is not what I need.
If I use 20 and subtract 12, I get 8. This means I can add 24 to 8 to make 32.
So, the equation would be: (20 - 12) + 24 = 32.
</think>
<answer> (20 - 12) + 24 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers given: 78, 35, and 47. We need to create an equation that equals 66 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
The number 78 seems quite large, and when subtracted from 66, we get a negative number which is not helpful.
Let's try using 35 and 47 together in a calculation first:
35 + 47 = 82
Now we need to use 78 to reach 66. Since 78 is much larger than the target 66, we need to think of some way to reduce its value.
Considering subtraction:
78 - 35 = 43
Now we need 23 more to reach 66 (since 66 - 43 = 23).
So, 47 - 23 = 24, which is not needed but the equation is closer to 66.
Considering any other operation, multiplication or division of 78 and 35 or 47 seems less likely to reduce the value of 78 to 66 directly.
Instead, let's consider:
78 - (47 - 35) = 78 - 12 = 66
This equation uses all numbers exactly once and equals 66.
</think>
<answer> (78 - (47 - 35)) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the target number we're trying to reach: 92.
We have the numbers 95, 37, and 34. 
95 is quite close to 92 and 95 - 3 = 92. 
So, using 95 - 3 = 92 seems to be a solution. 
However, 3 isn't available, so we need to find another way around this.
34 + 37 = 71, which is too low.
Combining 95 - 37 = 58, which still is more than 92.
Let's try 95 - 37 + 34. 
95 - 37 = 58, and then 58 + 34 = 92. 
This combination works because it uses each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 37) + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> Starting with the numbers [95, 37, 34], we need to create an equation that equals 92 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's see if we can get close to 92 by adding and subtracting the numbers:
95 - 37 = 58
We're 34 away from 92, and 34 is one of our numbers. So we can use this.
So, (95 - 37) + 34 = 58 + 34 = 92.
Therefore, the equation is: (95 - 37) + 34 = 92.
</think>
<answer> (95 - 37) + 34 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's look at the numbers we have: 26, 1, and 64. We need to create an equation that equals 37 using each number exactly once.
The number 37 is close to 64 but much lower than 26. This suggests we might subtract 26 and then add a much smaller number to reach 37.
64 - 26 = 38, which is very close to 37.
We need to get from 38 to 37, so we need to subtract 1.
Therefore, the equation would be: 64 - 26 - 1 = 37.
</think>
<answer> (64 - 26) - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> I need to use the numbers 26, 1, and 64 exactly once to make 37. Let's start by looking at the larger number, 64, as it's significantly larger and will help with the target number 37. 
If I subtract 64 from 37, I get -27, which isn't helpful. Let's try adding 1 and 26 instead.
1 + 26 = 27. If I subtract 64 from it, I get -37, which is still not the target number 37. 
Given this, let's consider another approach: maybe combining 1 and 26 in a different way to get closer to 37.
If I multiply 1 by itself, I get 1. If I then add 26, I get 27. Now if I add 64, I get 91, which is too large.
Instead, let's try 1 * 26 + 64:
1 * 26 + 64 = 26 + 64 = 90.
This is still far too large. 
We must try subtracting 64 from 90:
90 - 64 = 26.
Still not 37. X
Given 1, 26, and 64 are used, I need to subtract 26 from 64:
64 - 26 = 38.
Now to adjust from 38 to 37: 
Let me try subtracting 1 from 38:
38 - 1 = 37.
So the equation should be 64 - 26 - 1 = 37.
</think>
<answer> (64 - 26) - 1 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I need to find a way to use the numbers 67, 65, and 40 to get 42. 
- 67 is the largest number and could give us a larger number if subtracted from. 
- 65 is close to 42, so maybe we can use subtraction from 67.
- 40 could be subtracted from 65 or 67 to get closer to 42.
Let's try 67 - 65 + 40. 
67 - 65 = 2
Now we have 2 + 40 = 42.
</think>
<answer> (67 - 65) + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 29, 51, and 50. Our goal is to create an equation that equals 30 using each number exactly once.
One way to approach this is to think of combinations that could lead to 30. 51 - 21 would give us 30, but 21 is not in our set of numbers. 
Then, 50 - 20 would also give us 30, but 20 is also not in our set.
However, considering another combination, if we use 51 - 21, we can break 21 into 50 - 29. 
So, 51 - (50 - 29) = 51 - 50 + 29 = 1 + 29 = 30.
</think>
<answer> (51 - (50 - 29)) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I'll consider the numbers and the target value (38). I notice that 59 is quite large and 51 is also quite close to our target, so I might use subtraction to bring the sum down.
If I subtract 51 from 59, I get 8.
Now, I need to get from 8 to 38. I see that 30 is close to 38, so I can use addition.
If I add 30 to 8, I get 38.
Therefore, the equation is 59 - 51 + 30 = 38.
</think>
<answer> (59 - 51) + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 47, 98, and 77 that can be manipulated using basic arithmetic operations to equal 68.
I notice that 98 - 47 = 51. This gets me close but too high.
Next, if I use subtraction between 98 and 77, I get 98 - 77 = 21. Now I have 47, 21, and I need 68.
I see that by adding 47 and 21, I get 68 (47 + 21 = 68).
So the equation combining all parts is: (98 - 77) + 47 = 68.
</think>
<answer> (98 - 77) + 47 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the target number we want to achieve, which is 51. We have the numbers 36, 85, and 2 to work with. 
85 is the largest number and could potentially be subtracted from or added to another number to move closer to 51. Let's try subtracting 36 from 85:
85 - 36 = 49
Now, we need an additional 2 to reach 51. We can easily achieve this by adding 2 to 49:
49 + 2 = 51
So, the equation we have is 85 - 36 + 2 = 51.
</think>
<answer> (85 - 36) + 2 </answer>

<think> First, let's consider the numbers we have: 7, 95, 83, 49. We need to get to 30 using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
We know that 95 - 83 = 12, which is close to 30, but too high. Let's try to adjust it.
Now, 95 - 83 = 12, and 49 - 12 = 37, which is too high. But if we subtract 7 instead of 12, we get:
49 - 7 = 42, which still isn't right. Let's try 49 - (95 - 83).
This would be 49 - 12 = 37, and then subtract the 7 to get 30: 49 - (95 - 83) - 7 = 30.
Thus, the equation that works is 49 - (95 - 83) - 7 = 30.
</think>
<answer> 49 - (95 - 83) - 7 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's look at the numbers we have: 42, 71, and 44. We need to create an equation that equals 73 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by examining the differences and sums:
- 71 - 42 = 29
- 44 - 29 = 15 (a number close to 73 but not there yet)
- 73 - 15 = 58 (we're getting closer)
Now, consider the remaining number 42. If we try to use it in other combinations:
- 44 + 42 = 86 (too high)
- 73 - 44 = 29 (already seen)
- 73 - 42 = 31 (also seen)
- 73 - 29 = 44 (already seen)
The only straightforward combination that works is to use 71 - 42 and then add 44:
71 - 42 + 44 = 73
</think>
<answer> (71 - 42) + 44 </answer>

First, I'll consider the numbers and the target result. We need to get 17 using 27, 62, and 18. 
Let's start with subtraction:
- 62 - 18 = 44
This got us closer but doesn't help us reach 17.
Let's try addition and subtraction:
- 27 + 18 = 45
This is a bit higher than our target.
Now let's try a combination:
- 62 - 27 = 35
This also doesn't help us reach 17.
Looking at these results, seems like multiplication or division might be needed.
Let's think of a way to use all numbers:
- 62 / 27 = 2.296... (not an integer)
This isn't helping either.
Now, what if we try:
- (27 - 18) + 62
This simplifies to:
- 9 + 62 = 71
This is still not 17.
Finally, trying:
- 62 - (27 + 18)
This simplifies to:
- 62 - 45 = 17
This matches our target.
Therefore, the equation is 62 - (27 + 18).
</think>
<answer> 62 - (27 + 18) </answer>

==============
<think> First, let's consider the numbers and the desired result (17). We have three numbers: 27, 62, and 18.
We can start by trying to form the equation using basic operations.
Noting that 27 + 18 = 45 which is more than 17, and 62 is far from 17, let's try combinations:
27 - 62 = -35 (too small)
18 - 27 = -9 (too small)
27 - 18 = 9 (too small)
62 - 27 = 35 (too large)
We can't simply subtract to get 17.
Now, let's try addition of parts of the numbers:
62 - 45 (27 + 18) = 17
This gives us our desired result of 17.
Therefore, the equation using the numbers 27, 62, and 18 to get 17 is: (62 - (27 + 18))
</think>
<answer> (62 - (27 + 18)) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider all the possible operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). 
We need to use each of the numbers [27, 62, 18] exactly once to get a result of 17.
18 looks like a good candidate for subtraction since it's small and can be subtracted from 27 or 62.
Let's see if we can get 17 by subtracting 18 from 27 or combining it with 62 in some way.
If we subtract 18 from 27, we get 9 (27 - 18 = 9). 
Adding the remaining number 62 to 9 would give us 71, which is not 17.
Now, let's consider the other operations. 
Multiplying 18 by 27 or 62 would result in very large numbers, and dividing 27 or 62 by 18 would give us decimals that are not 17. 
Therefore, subtracting 18 from 27 could give us a better starting point.
Let's try dividing 62 by 27. Performing this operation gives us approximately 2.3077, which is not equal to 17. 
Next, let's try combining these numbers in another way. 
We can try 62 - 27 - 18 = 17. This seems to be the correct combination since 62 - 27 = 35, and then 35 - 18 = 17.
So our equation is 62 - 27 - 18 = 17.
</think>
<answer> (62 - 27) - 18 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I need to find a combination using the numbers 67, 88, 84, and 59 that equals 12. 
Let's consider the numbers and the operations that might help. 
88 - 84 = 4, which brings us close but not to 12. 
67 - 59 = 8, which is close but again not exactly 12. 
Considering addition or multiplication could help reach the goal. 
If we use 67 + 88, we get 155, which is too high.
88 + 59 = 147, which is also too high.
84 + 59 = 143, which is still too high.
If we look at (88 + 84) - 67, that would be 172 - 67 = 105 which is still high.
Let's check if there is another way to use the numbers: 
(88 - 59) + (84 / 7) * 2, but this uses division and doesn't simplify easily.
Finally, if we consider a different approach: 
After trying different combinations, it seems we need a subtraction and possibly a division or multiplication to get to 12.
67 - (84 / 7) = 67 - 12 = 55 which is too low.
88 - (84 / 7) = 88 - 12 = 76 which is too high.
Indeed, (88 + 59) / 7 = 147 / 7 = 21 which is too high.
Given these attempts, the only plausible way is to structure the equation as:
84 + (88 - 59) = 84 + 29 = 113 which is far off.
Finally, recombining slight adjustments:
Trying 88 - 59 + 67 / 7 is plausible but complex.
As the exact option seems elusive, another approach could be:
Simplified: (67 + 59) - 88 = 126 - 88 = 38 which is still too high.
This process illustrates that with each approach, complex or combinations made our sum either too high or low significantly.
Given constraints and operations, the direct 12 from the numbers without a fundamental error or common arithmetic mistake isn't directly visible.
Thus, rechecking shows initial attempts with basic operations show 84 + 59 - 88 = 25 or more nuanced complex combinations still causing failure in achieving directly 12.
The direct achievable structure finally suggesting 84 + (59 - 88) in minimal steps towards 12 is not feasible.
</think>
<answer> (88 - 59) + (67 - 84) </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 52, 92, and 26. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 66 using basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the higher numbers, 92 and 52. Subtracting 52 from 92 gives us 40. Now we have the numbers 26, 40, and we need to reach 66.
Next, we see that if we use the number 26, we need to add a certain value to 40 to get to 66. Calculating 66 - 40 gives 26, which matches our remaining number.
So, the equation can be constructed as:
(92 - 52) + 26 = 66
</think>
<answer> (92 - 52) + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the target number we want to achieve: 11.
We have the numbers 62, 29, 99, and 6 to use.
If we look at the equation, we might notice that 99 - 62 = 37, which is too big.
Then, let's try 99 - 29, but that gives us 70, which is also not what we want.
Let's try smaller numbers. 62 - 29 gives us 33, still not our target.
Now, let's think about multiplication or division. If we divide 62 by 6, we get 10.3333, which is close but not exactly 11.
Finally, let's consider 99 - (62 - 29). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. 62 - 29 = 33
2. 99 - 33 = 66, which is too big.
3. Let's try another way: 99 - 29 - 62 = -12, still not 11.
4. We notice a mistake here. We should try: 99 - (62 - 29) = 99 - 33 = 66, which was incorrect.
5. Rechecking, 99 - 29 gives us 70, and then we subtract 62 giving us 70 - 62 = 8.
6. Finally, 99 - 29 = 70, and then we subtract 62 + 29 = 61, and subtract 62 again, we get 8, but we need 11.
7. Correct calculation: (99 - 29) - 62 = 70 - 62 = 8.
8. Trying one more time: (99 - 29) / 6 = 70 / 6, which is approximately 11.67, close but not it now.
9. Correct overall: (99 - 29) - 6 = 60 - 6 = 54, which is not correct.
10. Trying: (99 - 62) - 29 = 37 - 29 = 8, which is too small.
11. Realizing: 99 - 62 - 29 = 37 - 29 = 8
12. Rechecking correctly: (99 - 62) / 6 = 37 / 6 = 6.17 which is incorrect.
13. Trying: 62 / 6 = 10.33, we need 11, so (99 - 62) / 6 + 1 = 37/6 + 1
14. Proper final equation: (99 - 62 + 29) / 6 = 66 / 6 = 11
</think>
<answer> (99 - 62 + 29) / 6 </answer>

First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 35, 77, and 27 that adds up or subtracts to 69 when combined appropriately with the basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to see if we can form numbers close to 69 using these digits.
If we try 77 - 35, we get 42. This is not 69.
Trying 77 - 27, we get 50. Still not 69.
Adding 35 and 27 gives us 62. This is close but not 69.
Then, let's try: (77 - 35) + 27 = 42 + 27 = 69.
This gives us the correct result.
</think>
<answer> (77 - 35) + 27 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's look at the target number we want to reach: 65.
We have the numbers 25, 6, 37, and 3 to work with.
25 + 6 + 37 equals 68, which is close to 65, but a bit too high.
If we subtract 3 from 68, we get 65.
So, the equation looks like this: (25 + 6 + 37) - 3 = 65.
Now let's check our numbers were used only once: 25, 6, 37, and 3 were all used once as we added them together in the first part of the equation.
</think>
<answer> (25 + 6 + 37) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the target result, which is 32. We have the numbers 50, 37, and 45 to use.
Let's try to explore operations that might lead us there:
1. One approach could be to use subtraction: 50 - 37 seems promising since it gives 13, which is close to 32. 
2. We need an additional number, and 45 is the only number left. 
3. If we add 45 to 13, we get 58, which is too high.
4. If we subtract 45 from 13, we get -32, which is still not 32.
5. If we subtract 13 from 45, we get 32, which matches our target.
So, we could use subtraction and subtraction: 
45 - (50 - 37) = 32
</think>
<answer> (45 - (50 - 37)) </answer>

<think> 
First, let's examine the numbers we have: 4, 27, and 89. 
We need to create an equation that equals 66 using all these numbers only once.
Looking at the numbers, 89 and 27 are relatively large and 4 is small. 
Let's try to use subtraction creatively.
If we subtract 4 from 27, we get 23. 
27 - 4 = 23.
Now we need to combine 23 and 89 to get to 66.
If we add 23 and 43, we reach 66. But we only have one number left.
Notice that 89 - 23 is 66.
So, our equation becomes: 
89 - (27 - 4) = 66.
</think>
<answer> (89 - (27 - 4)) </answer>

First, I need to find a combination of the given numbers (60, 91, 61, 26) that can result in 64 when using basic arithmetic operations. 
Starting with the numbers, 91 and 61 could be combined with subtraction: 
91 - 61 = 30
Then I need 34 more to reach 64 (64 - 30 = 34). 
26 and 60 could be used to make 34: 
60 - 26 = 34
So the equation combining these results is:
(91 - 61) + (60 - 26) = 64
</think>
<answer> (91 - 61) + (60 - 26) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I need to get close to 64 using the given numbers. The target numbers are 60, 91, 61, and 26.
91 - 60 = 31
Now I have 31 and 61, and need to reach 64.
61 - 26 = 35
This brings me closer to the target but overshoots it. 
31 + 35 = 66 is too much.
Now let me try a different combination:
61 - 26 = 35
35 + 31 = 66
I need to rethink this. If I use 26, 61, and the result of 91 - 60 = 31:
31 + 26 = 57
And then:
57 + 31 = 88 which is too much.
Let's try another approach:
91 - 61 = 30
30 + 26 = 56
This is still not 64.
I will use:
61 - 26 = 35
60 + 35 = 95 which is too much.
Now I recall the approach:
Using 91 - 61 = 30
30 + (60 - 26) = 30 + 34 = 64
So, the correct equation is:
(91 - 61) + (60 - 26) = 64
</think>
<answer> (91 - 61) + (60 - 26) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's look at the numbers we have: 60, 91, 61, and 26. We need to create an equation that equals 64 using each number exactly once.
Looking at the numbers, 91 - 61 = 30. This could be useful.
Now, if we take 60 - 26, we get 34. So, we have 30 and 34.
To get to 64 using 30 and 34, we could add 34 (from 60 - 26) to 34 (from 91 - 61), but that would give us 68, which is too high.
However, if we go back to 34 and add 30, it will give us exactly 64.
So, the equation is: (91 - 61) + (60 - 26) = 64.
</think>
<answer> ((91 - 61) + (60 - 26)) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I need to find a combination using the numbers 63, 7, and 19 that equals 51.
Looking at the numbers, we see that 63 is quite large and 19 is small, so I might need to subtract 19 and then add or subtract something else to reach 51.
If I subtract 19 from 63, I get 44. Now I need to get to 51 from 44 using the numbers 7. If I add 7 to 44, I get 51 exactly.
So the equation is: 63 - 19 + 7 = 51.
</think>
<answer> (63 - 19) + 7 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I need to get close to 85 using the given numbers 90, 31, 50, and 76.
90 - 50 = 40
Now I need 45 more to reach 85, starting with 40.
76 - 31 = 45
So, I now have two parts: 40 and 45.
I can combine these using addition: 40 + 45 = 85
Therefore, the equation is 90 - 50 + 76 - 31 = 85.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 50) + (76 - 31) </answer>

<think> 
First, let's look at the given numbers: 47, 98, and 53. We need to create an equation that equals 92 using each number exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by trying to make the equation simpler. Noting that 98 - 53 = 45 and 47 + 45 = 92, we can form the equation.
So, the equation would be 47 + (98 - 53) = 92.
</think>
<answer> (47 + 98 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the target number we need to achieve: 31.
Looking at the numbers we have [24, 4, 41, 18], we can notice that 41 is quite close to 31, so it's a good candidate to use as a part of the equation.
Now, let's subtract 10 from 41 to get 31. We can subtract 4 from 18 to get 14, which when added to 24 gives us 48 and when reduced by 14 gives us 34, almost there.
So, the equation would be: 41 + (18 - 4) - 24.
Let's verify:
41 + (18 - 4) - 24 = 41 + 14 - 24 = 55 - 24 = 31.
</think>
<answer> (41 + (18 - 4) - 24) </answer>

<think> 
First, I'll consider the numbers we have: 97, 69, and 39. We want to create an equation that equals 67 using each number only once.
One approach is to think about subtraction, as it can bring the numbers closer to the target number. 
If I subtract 39 from 69, I get 30. 
Next, I need to get from 30 to 67 using the remaining number, 97. 
To achieve this, I can subtract 30 from 97, which equals 67.
So, the equation would be: (97 - 69) + 39 = 67.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 69) + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> 
To create an equation using the numbers [97, 69, 39] that equals 67, let's consider the operations we can use:
1. First, let's try combining the numbers in a way that might cancel out or simplify to get close to 67.
2. Looking at the numbers, 97 - 69 = 28, which is far from 67.
3. Now, let's see if we can get closer: 97 - 69 - 39 = -21, which is still not 67.
4. Here, we might think about including the 39 differently. Perhaps we can use multiplication and subtraction. If we rearrange and add 39 to the mix, we might get:
5. (97 - 69) + 39 = 28 + 39 = 67.
6. Thus, the equation (97 - 69) + 39 equals 67.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 69) + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the target number we need to reach: 53.
We have the numbers 13, 50, and 10 available.
If we look at 50 - 10, we get 40. 
Now, to get from 40 to 53, we need to add 13.
So, the equation looks like this: (50 - 10) + 13 = 53.
</think>
<answer> (50 - 10) + 13 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the target number we want to reach: 55.
We have the numbers 8, 39, and 24 available.
If we look at 39 + 24 = 63, we're very close to 55, but slightly off.
If we subtract 8 from 63, we get 55.
So, the equation would be: 63 - 8 = 55.
But we need to construct 63 using only 8, 39, and 24.
Another way to think about it is using the numbers we have to make 63.
Let's try: 39 + 24 + 8 = 61, which is close to 63.
So, subtracting 2 from 61 gives us 59. 
This isn't quite right, so let's try another way:
If we use 39 + (24 - 8), we get 39 + 16 = 55.
This gives us our target number 55.
So, the correct expression to get 55 using 8, 39, and 24 is (39 + (24 - 8)).
</think>
<answer> (39 + (24 - 8)) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 3, and 23. We need to form an equation using these numbers with basic arithmetic operations that equals 89.
One approach could be to use subtraction and addition. 
If we subtract 23 from 69, we get 46. 
Then, to reach 89, we need to add a number to 46. 
The remaining number is 3, which needs to be combined with the previous result.
Adding 3 to 46 gives us 49, but this is not 89.
Instead, let's try another combination: 
Using 69 - 23 = 46, then using 3 * 2 (since 23 + the result is not working here, let's use multiplication with 3) should help close the gap.
3 * 2 = 6, then 46 + 6 = 52 which is still not 89.
Another combination to consider is:
69 - 3 = 66, then 66 + 23 = 90, still not 89.
Finally, let's consider:
69 - 23 = 46, and then subtract 23 from 46 to get 23, but we need 89.
Since all previous attempts didn't work out, reconsidering, we can try:
23 + 69 = 92, then subtract 3 = 89.
So, the correct equation should be:
23 + 69 - 3 = 89.
</think>
<answer> (23 + 69) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I need to find a combination that will add up to or come close to 23 because 69 - 46 = 23. 
Looking at the numbers, 14 + 18 = 32, which is quite close.
If I use 18 in the equation, the remaining numbers are 14 and 37. 
Now, 37 - 14 = 23.
So, to get 69, I need 37 + (18 + 14).
This can be written as:
(37 + (18 + 14))
</think>
<answer> (37 + (18 + 14)) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 81, 39, and 33. We need to create an equation that equals 75 using these numbers only once. 

One effective way to approach this is to explore combinations of addition and subtraction. Let's try:
81 - 39 = 42, but this is too high for our target.
Next, let's try 81 - 33 = 48, which is also too high.
Now, 39 + 33 = 72, which is close but still too high.

Finally, let's try a subtraction followed by an addition:
81 - 33 = 48
Then, 48 + 7 = 55 (this is incorrect), but if we check if 7 can be derived from the given numbers, we see that 81 - 39 = 42 and 42 + 13 = 55 (again, 13 is not available).

Given the numbers 81, 39, and 33, it seems challenging to get exactly 75 using basic arithmetic operations. However, we notice that:
81 - 33 = 48
75 - 48 = 27, and 27 cannot be derived directly from the given numbers.

Upon re-evaluation, it's apparent we need to rethink our approach. Let's try a different combination focusing on the order of operations or looking for another way to combine the numbers:
If we try 81 - (39 + 33) = 81 - 72 = 9, which is far from 75. 
Another attempt could be 39 + 33 = 72, then subtract 47 (which is not available).

After these tests, we realize a mistake in our direct approach. Re-checking logical combinations:
Taking 81 and 39, we can do 81 - 39 = 42, then we need 33 + something = 33 + 33 = 66 (too far) or 33 + 7 = 40 (still far). The only valid logical equation is:
81 - 39 + 33 = 75

Thus, the equation that equals 75 is: 81 - 39 + 33 = 75.
</think>
<answer> 81 - 39 + 33 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the target number we want to reach, which is 23.
Now, if we look at the numbers provided, 81 seems to be too big to be subtracted from 23 directly or added to a number to reach 23.
38 is also too big in that regard. 
So let's consider 66. 
If we subtract 66 from 81, we get 15, which is close but not quite what we need.
Let's try to see if we can adjust this by adding and/or subtracting 38:
- If we subtract 81 and add 38, we get 81 - 38 = 43, which is too high.
- If we add 38 to 66, we get 66 + 38 = 104, which is too high.
- If we subtract 38 from 81, we get 81 - 38 = 43, again too high.
- And if we subtract 66 from 38, we get 38 - 66 = -28, which is not 23.
Considering these attempts, it seems difficult to reach 23 with simple addition, subtraction, and use of the numbers only once. 
But, let's see if combining different operations might yield a solution.
Let's see:
(81 - 66) / 38 = 15 / 38, which is not 23.
(66 + 38) - 81 = 104 - 81 = 23, which is exactly what we needed.
So we could use (66 + 38) - 81 = 23.

First, let's analyze the given numbers: 74, 73, and 24. We need to create an equation that equals 25 using only these numbers once.
Let's consider subtraction as it can easily lead to the results we need.
Using 74 - 73 = 1, we have something closer to 25.
Now, we need to reach 25 from 1 with the help of our last number, 24.
So, we can use 1 + 24 = 25.
Combining these, we get the equation: 74 - 73 + 24 = 25.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 8, 2, and 85. Our goal is to create an equation that equals 75 using each number only once.
We can start by looking at the larger number, 85. We can subtract 8 from 85 to get 77. 
Now we have the numbers 2 and 77. We need to get to 75, so we do 77 - 2 = 75.
So the equation we have is 85 - 8 - 2 = 75.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 1, 6, and 97. We need to create an equation that equals 90 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
The number 97 is quite close to 90, so if it could be part of a subtraction, we might get something useful. Let's try:
97 - 6 = 91, which is close to 90 but not quite there.
Now, let's try adding smaller numbers:
1 + 6 = 7, and then we would need to get from 7 to 90. We could do:
90 - 7 = 83, but we need to use the remaining 1, which doesn't help.
Given these attempts, let's try a combination of subtraction and addition:
97 - 6 - 1 = 90.
Therefore, the equation is:
(97 - 6 - 1)

<answer> (97 - 6 - 1) </answer>

First, I need to find a way to use the given numbers to get 28. Looking at the numbers [52, 86, 85, 25], subtraction might be useful since we can get close to 28 by subtracting a larger number from a larger one.
- If I subtract 25 from 52, I get 27.
- Now I need 1 more to reach 28, but 27 is close.
- I can get 1 from 86 - 85, which is 1.
- Adding 1 to 27 gives me 28.
So, the equation is (86 - 85) + (52 - 25) = 28.

<answer> ((86 - 85) + (52 - 25)) </answer>

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 83, 26, and 36.
We need to create an equation that equals 73 using these numbers exactly once.
If we look at 83 - 26, we get 57. This is close but not 73.
We can try 83 - 36, which gives 47. Still not 73.
Now, let's try adding 26 to 36: 26 + 36 = 62. This isn't 73 either.
Finally, let's try 83 - 36 + 26. Here's the calculation:
83 - 36 = 47
47 + 26 = 73
So we have 83 - 36 + 26 = 73.

First, I need to find a way to get close to 97 using the numbers provided. One good strategy is to try to reach a larger number using some of the operations.
If we look at 8, it's a small number, so we need to find a way to make it significant. If we add 61 and then subtract 8, we get:
61 + 8 = 69
Now we need to add 28 more to reach 97.
Looking at the remaining numbers, 15 and 43, if we subtract 15 from 43, we get:
43 - 15 = 28
So combining all the steps:
61 + 8 - 15 = 54 + 28 = 82 + 15 = 97
Therefore, the equation is 61 + 8 - 15 + 43 = 97.

First, let's consider the numbers given: 61, 66, and 63. We need to create an equation that equals 64 using each number once with basic arithmetic operations.
61 - 63 = -2
This gives us our first number, -2, but we need a positive number. Let's try adding numbers.
If we add 66 and -2, we get:
66 + (-2) = 64
Therefore, the equation is:
66 - 63 + 61 = 64

First, I need to consider how multiplication and addition can help me reach 100 using the given numbers. 
The number 77 is close to 100, so I can start with that. 
If I use 77 + 29, I get 106, which is close to 100. 
Now, I need to make it exactly 100. 
Since 106 - 7 = 99, I just need to add 1 more to reach 100. 
I can add this 1 to 7 by using 13 - 12, but since 12 is not available, I can use 13 - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1, but a simpler solution is to use 13 - 12 = 1, which is not possible with numbers given. 
Another way is to consider if there's any other way to get 1 using provided numbers. 13 - 7 = 6, and 13 - 29 = -17, and 13 * 77 = 1001, which are clearly wrong.
So, the accurate approach is to use 77 + 29 + 7 - 13 = 100.

First, let's look at the numbers we have: 45, 62, and 56. We need to create an equation that equals 51 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
If we subtract 56 from 62, we get 6. 
Now we have the numbers 45, 6, and we need to get 51.
If we add 45 and 6, we get 51.
So, the equation is: 45 + (62 - 56) = 51

First, I need to find a way to get close to 80 using the numbers 84, 96, 99, and 1.
1. I notice that 99 - 1 = 98 is quite close to 80.
2. Now, I need to get from 98 to 80 using 84 and 96.
3. The difference between 98 and 80 is 18.
4. Now, let's see how I can get 18 with the remaining numbers 84 and 96.
5. I see that 96 - 84 = 12 is not enough.
6. But if I add 84 and then subtract 96, I get 84 - 96 + 84 = -12 + 84 = 72, which is too much.
7. Instead, I should use 84 + (96 - 99) = 84 + (96 - 99) = 84 - 3 = 81, which is close.
8. To get exactly 80, I can subtract 1 more from 81.
Therefore, the equation is: 84 + (96 - 99) - 1 = 80.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 35, 46, and 62. We need to create an equation that equals 51 using each number exactly once.
One approach is to try to use subtraction and addition to get the result. 
We can start by subtracting 35 from 62 to get 27.
Now we need another number to reach 51. 
27 + 24 = 51, but we only have one more number and it is 46. 
Let's try the reverse: 46 - 24 = 22, and then 22 + 29 = 51.
However, 29 is not available as it's not a combination of the given numbers.
Instead, we should aim to use the numbers as they are and combine them.
We notice that 46 - 35 + 62 is closer to 51 but still not exact.
Another combination is 62 - 46 - 35 which is -19.
Clearly, I need to recombine the options.
Instead, let's try 62 - 46 + 35 = 51.
This gives us the result we need: 62 - 46 + 35 = 51.

To create an equation that equals 49 using the numbers 14, 7, and 5 exactly once, I need to explore different combinations of operations.
- First, note that 49 is not a simple multiplication or division of any two of these numbers directly (14 * 7 = 98, 14 * 5 = 70, 7 * 5 = 35).
- Considering addition, we could try 14 + 7 + 5, but that equals 26, which is too small.
- Trying multiplication and addition, 14 * 7 gives us 98, which is too large.
- Also, 14 + 7 + 5 = 26, isn't suitable as well.
- Now, let's consider 49 as a combination of operations.
- If we rearrange the numbers, trying 14 * 7 - 5 or 7 * 5 + 14; we can evaluate those options.
- Evaluating 14 * 7 - 5: (14 * 7) = 98, and 98 - 5 = 93, which is too high.
- Evaluating 7 * 5 + 14: (7 * 5) = 35, and 35 + 14 = 49. This works.
</think>
<answer> (7 * 5) + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's look at the numbers we have: 14, 7, and 5. We need to create an equation that equals 49 using these numbers only once.
One way to approach this is to consider if multiplication can help us quickly reach 49. Notice that 14 * 7 = 98, which is close to 49 but too high. We can reverse this by using division to get closer to 49.
If we use 14 * 7 and then divide by 5, we can account for the extra 49 by manipulation.
So, (14 * 7) / 5 = 98 / 5 = 19.6, which is still not 49.
A different approach could be halving 14, but it doesn't seem to fit well here.
Another way could be to think about splitting or combining numbers differently.
Let's try manipulating using subtraction and addition instead:
(14 - 5) * 7 = 9 * 7 = 63, which is too high.
Let's try a combination:
5 * 7 - 14 = 35 - 14 = 21, which is too low.
Finally, we need to get the equation to 49. Considering the options, we can try:
(14 * 3) - (7 + 5) = 42 - 12 = 30, which is still not 49.
Upon reevaluation, one combination comes out clearly:
(14 - 5) * 7 / 2 = 9 * 7 / 2 = 8.5 * 7 = 49. 
However, we need to keep the numbers used exactly as given and without fractions directly.
(14 - 5) * 7 / 2 doesn't work out.
Finally, a plausible approach:
(14 + 7) * 5 / 2 should evaluate to 49 by using only the numbers provided.
But 14 + 7 * 5/2 instead, we get:
5 * 7 + 14 = 35 + 14 = 49.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 38, 59, and 12. We need to form an equation that equals 85 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
If we look at the target number (85), we can try to see if we can get closer to 85 using smaller numbers. 
Subtracting 12 from 59 gives us 47. 
Now, we need 38 more to reach 85. We already have 47, so we need to find a way to get 28 more from the numbers we have, which means we need to use either 38 or 12 in a different combination.
Now, considering 38: 
- Adding 38 to 47 gives us 85 exactly. 
Thus, the equation could be 59 - 12 + 38.

First, I need to find a combination that can lead to 77 using the numbers 45, 50, and 82 exactly once.
I notice that 82 is quite large, so using it directly in subtraction or addition with 45 and 50 won't lead to 77 quickly. 
Considering subtraction from 82:
82 - 45 = 37
This leaves us with 40 (77 - 37), and we still need to use 50. 
If I consider adding 50 to 37:
37 + 50 = 87, but this is too high.
Instead, let's think about division and addition:
82 - 50 = 32
Now we have 45 and 32. 
32 + 45 = 77
So the equation becomes 82 - 50 + 45 = 77.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 16, 64, and 25. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 23.
We can start by adding or subtracting the smallest number, 25, as it is farthest from 23.
If we subtract 25 from 64, we get 39, which is too large. If we subtract 25 from 16, we get -9, which is too small.
Next, let's try combining 16 and 64. The obvious way to do this is by adding them together: 16 + 64 = 80, which is not our target.
Finally, let's try the combination 64 - 16 = 48. This is still not 23, so we need to find a way to adjust this result to 23.
We can subtract 25 from 48 to get 23. This works perfectly because we have used all three numbers exactly once.
So the equation is 64 - 16 - 25 = 23.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 90, 55, and 30. We need to use these numbers once each to get an equation that equals 65.
Looking at the numbers, we might consider subtraction because 90 - 55 = 35, which is close to 65 but too low. Adding 30 to 35 would get us closer (35 + 30 = 65), but 30 is not the biggest number we have.
Instead, let's try a different combination. If we use 90 - 55 and then add the third number, 30, we get:
90 - 55 + 30 = 35 + 30 = 65
This meets our requirement of using the numbers exactly once and results in 65.
</think>
<answer> (90 - 55) + 30 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I need to create an equation that equals 65 using the numbers 90, 55, and 30 exactly once. 
I notice that 90 + 55 = 145, which is too large, and 90 - 30 = 60 is close but not 65.
Then, I consider 55 - 30 = 25. This leaves me with 40 more to reach 65.
If I subtract 25 from 65, I get 40, which is exactly what I need.
So, the equation can be: (55 - 30) + 40 - 90.
However, this doesn't use numbers correctly and doesn't equal 65. I realize my mistake - I should first reach 65 directly by subtraction.
If I use 90 - 55 = 35 as a starting point, then 35 - 30 = 5, and finally 65 - 5 = 60, which is close, but not exactly 65.
Realizing I made a mistake, I should consider a different approach. Since 55 + 30 = 85 is more than 65, I should look at 90 - 25 = 65, where 25 = 55 - 30.
Thus, the equation should be: 90 - (55 - 30).

First, let's examine the numbers we have: 5, 44, and 13.
We need to create an equation that equals 26 using these numbers exactly once.
We can start by looking at the sum and difference of the numbers:
44 - 13 = 31
We need to get from 31 to 26, and the only way to do that with the remaining number 5 is to subtract it:
31 - 5 = 26
So, the equation is:
(44 - 13) - 5 = 26
</think>
<answer> (44 - 13) - 5 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the target number we want to reach (26) and the numbers we have (45, 77, 6). We need to use each number only once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations.
Noting that 77 and 45 are quite large and 6 is small, it seems 6 might need to be manipulated somehow. 
We can try subtracting 6 from 77 to get a more manageable number: 
77 - 6 = 71.
Now we have 45, 71, and need 26. We need to find a way to manipulate these numbers.
Adding or subtracting 45 should not help quickly because we can only use each number once and 45 is bigger than 26.
We can try dividing 71 by 45 but this is not yielding a whole number. Maybe we can use multiplication or division with 6.
If we take 6 and multiply it by 45, we get 270 which is too large.
Now let's consider if we can use subtraction creatively. We know 45 + 26 = 71, so maybe we can subtract 6 from 45 and proceed.
45 - 6 = 39. Now we need 26 from 39:
39 - 13 = 26, but we don't have a 13.
Looking at our remaining numbers, 77, 45, and 6, if we subtract 45 from 77, we get 32 which is close, but we want 26.
Therefore, let's subtract 6 from 32 (which is 32 - 6 = 26), and we can do this by subtracting 6 from 77 and then subtracting 45 from the result.
(77 - 6) - 45 = 71 - 45 = 26.
So the equation is: 77 - 6 - 45 = 26.

First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 74, 21, and 53 that equals 42. 
- Calculating 74 - 53 gives me 21, which doesn't help much.
- Adding 21 and 53 gives me 74, which is close but again using 74 won't help us get to 42.
- Now, let's try 74 - (21 + 53): 
  - First, solve the addition inside the parenthesis: 21 + 53 = 74.
  - Then, subtracting this from 74: 74 - 74 = 0.
  - This is not 42, so this doesn't work.
- Now let's try a different approach: 
  - Calculate 74 - (53 + 21): 
    - First, solve the addition inside the parenthesis: 53 + 21 = 74.
    - Then, subtracting this from 74: 74 - 74 = 0.
  - This is still not 42.
- Trying 21 + 53 - 74: 
  - First, solve the addition: 53 + 21 = 74.
  - Then, subtracting 74 from this sum: 74 - 74 = 0.
  - This is not 42.
- Thinking about reordering: 
  - 53 - 21 + 74: 
    - First, solve the subtraction: 53 - 21 = 32.
    - Then, add the 74: 32 + 74 = 106.
    - This is not 42.
- Finally, trying - (53 + 21) + 74:
  - First, solve the addition: 53 + 21 = 74.
  - Then, subtracting this from 74 and negating it: -(74) + 74 = -74 + 74 = 0.
- This is still not 42.
- Trying a different mix:
  - 21 + (74 - 53): 
    - First, solve the subtraction: 74 - 53 = 21.
    - Then, add the 21: 21 + 21 = 42.
    - This gives us our answer 42.

First, let's consider the target number we need to reach: 68.
We have the numbers 24, 98, and 6 available.
One approach is to try combining these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
If we subtract 6 from 24, we get 18.
Now we need an operation to get from 18 to 68. 
98 is a large number, and subtracting or adding it directly won't help us reach 68 from 18.
However, dividing 98 by 6 leaves a remainder and doesn't give us a whole number close to 68.
Multiplying or adding/subtracting these numbers doesn't seem to work either.
Instead, consider the target result (68) and see how we can get closer to it with the smaller numbers.
Notice that if we cube 2 (which is 8), we get close to the figure we need.
So let's calculate 98 - 24 - 6:
98 - 24 = 74
Then,
74 - 6 = 68
Hence, the equation should be:
98 - 24 - 6 = 68

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 91, 51, and 67.
We need to create an equation that equals 75 using these numbers only once.
Let's look at the basic operations:
- Addition: 91 + 51 = 142 (too large)
- Subtraction: 91 - 51 = 40 (too small)
- Multiplication: 91 * 67 = 6037 (way too large)
- Division: 91 / 67 = 1.364 (not an integer and not close to 75)
Since simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division don't seem to yield 75, let's consider the possibility of combining them.
We notice that 91 - 67 = 24.
Now, let's see if we can get close to 75 with the numbers 24 and 51.
24 + 51 = 75.
This works!
Thus, the equation we are looking for is: 91 - 67 + 51 = 75.

First, we need to create an equation using the numbers 22, 17, and 17 that equals 22. 
We can start by seeing if we can use subtraction. If we subtract 17 from 17 we get 0. Then, we add this result to 22. 
So the equation would be: 
22 + (17 - 17) = 22 
Let's check:
22 + (17 - 17) = 22 + 0 = 22
This equation works, using each number only once.

First, I need to create an equation using the numbers 22, 17, and 17 that equals 22. 
I notice that 17 + 17 equals 34. 
If I subtract 17 from 34, I get 17. 
Now, if I subtract 17 from 22, I get 5. 
So, the equation would be 34 - 17 - 17 = 22.
However, we need to use the numbers 22, 17, and 17 only once each.
A better approach is to use them in a different order. 
If we take 22 - 17, we get 5.
Now, using the remaining 17 and 17, we can add them together to get 34.
Finally, to get 22, we subtract 34 from itself, which gives us 34 - 34 + 5 = 22.
So the equation can be: 34 - 34 + 5 = 22.
However, we need to strictly use the numbers 22, 17, and 17 as they appear. 
If I look at these numbers again, I realize that subtracting them in the proper order would work directly. 
Let's use: 22 - 17 + 17 = 22.
This meets all the requirements: each number is used only once, the equation equals 22.

93 is quite large and 20 and 26 are small numbers. 
Let's try to subtract the smaller numbers from 93 to get closer to 47. 
93 - 26 = 67
Now we need to get from 67 to 47, so we'll subtract another number. 
67 - 20 = 47
So, the equation is 93 - 26 - 20 = 47.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 99, 44, and 43. We need to create an equation using these numbers only once that equals 12 using basic arithmetic operations.
- The number 12 could be formed by 44 - 32. But we only have 99 and 43 available.
- If we add and subtract the numbers correctly, we can try:
  - 99 - 44 - 43: This equals 99 - 44 - 43 = 12. 
  - 99 - 44 + 43: This doesn't equal 12.
  - 44 - 99 + 43: This also doesn't equal 12.
- The only combination that works is 99 - 44 - 43.

First, let's consider the numbers and the target number. We have 7, 93, and 78, and we want to get 22. 
We can see that 93 - 78 = 15. 
Now we need to form 22 using 15 and 7. 
If we add 7 to 15, we get 22. So the equation becomes:
(93 - 78) + 7 = 22

First, I need to create an equation that uses the numbers 56, 1, and 79 to equal 24. 
Looking at the numbers, I notice that 79 - 56 = 23. This is close to 24.
If I add 1 to 23, I get 24, which is exactly what I need.
So, the equation would be (79 - 56) + 1 = 24.
</think>
<answer> (79 - 56) + 1 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 56, 1, and 79. We need to create an equation that equals 24 using these numbers with each number used exactly once.
One useful approach is to think about if one of the numbers can be manipulated to help us reach 24.
79 - 56 = 23, which is close to 24. 
Adding 1 to 23 gives us 24.
So the equation we can form is: (79 - 56) + 1 = 24.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 72, 75, and 73. 
We need to create an equation that equals 70 using each number only once.
Let's try to subtract some numbers.
75 - 73 = 2
This doesn't work as we need more to reach 70.
Now, let's try another combination:
75 - 73 = 2
Then, we have 72 left.
72 - 2 = 70
This combination works.
So, the equation is: 72 - (75 - 73) = 70.

First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 38, 3, and 72 that equal 31 using basic arithmetic operations.
Let's start by considering subtraction, since 72 is the largest number. If we subtract 72 from 38, we get:
38 - 72 = -34
This is not 31, so let's try another operation. Now, I'll consider adding 3 to the result:
-34 + 3 = -31
This is close, but we need a positive 31. Let's try another approach. What if we add 3 to 72 first:
72 + 3 = 75
Now we need to subtract 75 from 38 repeatedly:
38 - 75 = -37
This is not working either. Let's try another operation on 38 and 72 together before adding 3:
72 - 38 = 34
Now, we need to subtract 34 from 38 and add 3:
38 - 34 + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10
This is still not 31. Let me try a different combination:
72 - 38 + 3 = 34 + 3 = 37
This is too high. Let's try 38 - (72 - 72)
38 - 72 + 72 = 38
Now, let's subtract 38 from 31:
31 - 38 = -17
This is still not right. Finally, let's try 38 - 3 and then add 72:
38 - 3 = 35
35 + 72 = 107
This is too high. Let's try one more time with 72 - 3:
72 - 3 = 69
69 - 38 = 31
So we have the combination:
72 - 3 - 38 = 31
</think>
<answer> (72 - 3) - 38 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 45, 23, and 15. We need to combine these to get a result of 53.
One way to approach this is to see if we can get close to 53 by combining two of the numbers and then adjusting with the third.
23 + 15 = 38, which is close to 53. We need an additional 15 to reach 53.
Using 45 - (something) = 15 clarifies what needs to be subtracted from 45 to get 15. Clearly, 45 - 15 = 30.
However, we need 15, not 30. Let's backtrack. Instead of subtracting from 45, we should subtract from 38 (23 + 15).
38 - 15 = 23, which was part of our original sum. So, we need to adjust further by adding something to 15.
Since 15 is already part of 38, we can directly use the remaining as 15 to make it 53. 
Thus, we get: 45 - (23 + 15 - 15) = 53.
Actually, it's simpler if we directly use: 45 + 23 - (15 - 15) = 53.
Simplifying further: 45 + 23 - 0 = 68, and subtracting 15 gives: 68 - 15 = 53.
Correcting for simplicity: 45 + 23 - 15 = 53.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 10, 12, and 7. We need to create an equation that equals 15 using each number exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.
I see that 12 + 3 equals 15, so 3 could be our target number to find using only 10 and 7.
If we look closely, we can see that 10 - 7 = 3.
So, the equation will be: 12 + (10 - 7).

We need to create an equation using the numbers 81, 2, 1, and 15 that equals 93. Let's try combining them using basic arithmetic operations.
- First, 81 is quite large, so we might want to subtract from it.
- We have 15, which could help us get closer to 93. 
- Adding 15 to another number should help.
- Using 2 and 1, we can try combinations of addition and subtraction.
Let's try: \( 81 - 15 + 2 + 1 \)
\( = 66 + 2 + 1 \)
\( = 68 + 1 \)
\( = 69 \)
69 is not 93, so let's try another combination.
Now, let's try: \( 81 - 15 - 2 + 1 \)
\( = 66 - 2 + 1 \)
\( = 64 + 1 \)
\( = 65 \)
65 is still not 93, so let's consider other possible operations.
Another attempt: \( 81 + 15 - 2 + 1 \)
\( = 96 - 2 + 1 \)
\( = 94 + 1 \)
\( = 95 \)
95 is still not 93. 
Finally, let's try: \( 81 + 15 - 2 - 1 \)
\( = 96 - 2 - 1 \)
\( = 94 - 1 \)
\( = 93 \)
This works because 81 + 15 - 2 - 1 equals 93.

First, I need to create an equation that equals 22 using the numbers 28, 53, and 3. 
I notice that 53 - 3 = 50, which is a large number. 
If I subtract this from 28, I get 28 - 50 = -22, which is close but negative.
Instead, let's try using division. 
28 can be divided by 3 to get approximately 9. 33. 
Then, subtracting this from 53 gives us 53 - 9. 33 = 43. 67, which is still not 22.
To get closer, let's try a different approach: 
I can subtract 3 from 53 and then divide by 28 to get closer to 22.
53 - 3 = 50, and 50 / 28 is not exactly 22, but it's a closer approximation.
I need to adjust this a bit further. 
If I take 3 and add it to the result of 50 / 28, I should get closer.
50 / 28 + 3 ≈ 1. 7857 + 3 ≈ 4. 7857, which is still not 22.
I realize the exact solution might require a different combination, so let's try 53 - 28 = 25, and then subtract the remainder of 3 from 25 to adjust to 22.
53 - 28 = 25, and then 25 - 3 = 22, which is exactly what we're looking for.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 61, 80, and 90. We need to use these numbers to get a result of 71.
- If we try to subtract or add the numbers directly, we don't get 71 easily.
- Let's try combining the numbers in other ways. If we look at the operations we can use, multiplication and division can sometimes give us the necessary results.
- Considering multiplication of 80 and 90 gives us 720 which is a large number and closer to 71.
- Now, if we subtract 720 from 61, we get -659, which is not 71.
- Instead, let's consider dividing 720 by a number that isn't a digit. This could be tricky.
- Considering -61 + 80 = 19, which is still not useful for reaching 71.
- Now, let's try a different approach. We can use the distributive property of multiplication, but we have to think the other way round.
- 90 - 80 = 10 doesn't help either.
- However, if we think about 90 - (80/10) = 90 - 8 = 82 is close but too high.
- Let's solve it: 61 + (90/10) = 61 + 9 = 70 still not 71.
- Finally, 61 + (90 - 80) = 61 + 10 = 71
This gives us the number 71.

First, let's consider the target result: 63.
Looking at the numbers available [70, 60, 83, 30], we notice that 83 is the largest and 30 is the smallest. It seems likely that subtracting 30 from 83 could be part of the solution.
83 - 30 = 53
Next, we need an additional number to reach 63. We can use 60 to subtract from 53.
53 - 60 = -7
This isn't 63, so let's try using the remaining number, 70, in a different way.
We see that 70 - 60 = 10.
Now, to reach 63, we add 10 to 53.
53 + 10 = 63
Therefore, the final equation is: (83 - 30) + (70 - 60) = 63.

First, let's consider all the possible combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with the numbers 22, 88, and 26.
1. 88 - 26 = 62, which is not 22.
2. 88 + 26 = 114, which is not 22.
3. 88 / 26 = 3.38... (not an integer, not equal to 22).
4. 26 - 22 = 4, which is not 22.
5. 22 - 88 = -66, which is not 22.
6. 22 + 88 = 110, which is not 22.
7. 22 * 88 = 1936, which is not 22.
8. 22 / 88 = 0.257... (not equal to 22).
None of the above combinations worked using just these operations once. 
Let's try another approach:
2. 88 / (26 - 22) = 88 / 4 = 22
This combination meets the criteria because we are using each number only once and the equation equals 22.

<answer> 88 / (26 - 22) </answer>

First, we need to find a way to use the numbers 8, 38, and 58 to get 88. 
Let's start by looking at the numbers:
- 38 + 58 = 96
- 58 - 38 = 20
- The number 8 is already given.
96 is close to 88, and by subtracting 8 from 96, we can get the desired result.
(38 + 58) - 8 = 96 - 8 = 88
So, the equation is (38 + 58) - 8 = 88.

First, I need to create an equation that equals 26 using the numbers 29, 28, and 83 exactly once. 
Let's start by looking at the numbers and their possible combinations with the operations:
One combination could be: 83 - 29 - 28
But this doesn't give us 26.
Another combination is: 29 - 28 + 83
Let's calculate this:
29 - 28 = 1
Then, 1 + 83 = 84
This is also not 26.
Now let's try another approach: 
(83 - 29) + 28
(83 - 29) = 54
54 + 28 = 82
This is also not 26.
A different grouping could be:
29 + 83 - 28
29 + 83 = 112
112 - 28 = 84
This does not work either.
Let's try another combination:
(83 + 28) - 29
83 + 28 = 111
111 - 29 = 82
Not 26.
Finally, let's try:
(29 + 28) - 83
29 + 28 = 57
57 - 83 = -26
This isn't 26 but it is the closest using the numbers once.
However, we can try a different operation order:
29 + 28 - 83
29 + 28 = 57
57 - 83 = -26
No. It's still not 26.
The key was missed in the operations order, let's focus on: 
(29 - 28) + 83
29 - 28 = 1
1 + 83 = 84
But this is incorrect.
Finally, after several attempts, the correct equation:
29 + 28 - 83 = -36
This is still incorrect.
The correct yet simpler step might be:
(83 - 28) - 29
83 - 28 = 55
55 - 29 = 26
So the final equation is:
(83 - 28) - 29 = 26

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 50, 25, and 3.
We need to create an equation that equals 28 using each number exactly once.
Let's start with addition and subtraction:
- 50 + 25 = 75, but we need to reduce it to 28.
- 50 + 25 - 3 = 72, which is too high.
- 25 + 3 = 28, but we don't have 50 left.
- 50 + 3 = 53, which is too high.
Now, let's try multiplication and subtraction:
- 50 * 25 = 1250, which is clearly too high.
- 50 * 3 = 150, which is too high.
- 25 * 3 = 75, which is too high.
Let's try another approach:
- 25 - 3 = 22, and then we need 6 more to reach 28.
- 50 - 22 = 28, so we can use 50 - (25 - 3).
Therefore, the equation is 50 - (25 - 3).
</think>
<answer> (50 - (25 - 3)) </answer>

First, let's consider the target result: 28.
We have the numbers 50, 25, and 3 to use once each with basic arithmetic operations.
If we look at 50 - 25 = 25, we have 25 left to reach 28.
We know that 28 - 25 = 3.
So, 50 - 25 + 3 = 28.
Thus, the equation is (50 - 25) + 3 = 28.

First, let's consider the target number we need to reach, which is 97. 
We have three numbers: 2, 88, and 7.
88 is quite large, so subtracting it from 97 will quickly exceed our third number, 7.
If we add 7 to 88, we get 95, which is closer but still short of 97.
To hit exactly 97, we need 2 more. 
With the number 2, we can achieve this by simply adding it to 95.
So, the equation would be: (88 + 7) + 2 = 97.

First, I need to find a combination of the numbers 69, 18, and 34 using basic arithmetic operations to get 17.
Let's start with the smaller numbers: 18 - 34 doesn't work directly, and neither does adding 34 to 18.
Now, if I look at the difference, 69 - 34 = 35, which is far from 17. 
Multiplying 18 by 34 gives a very large number.
The reverse multiplication of 34 by 18 is 612, which is even more away from 17.
The only operation that can bring us closer to 17 is subtraction.
So, if I use 69 - 18, that would give me 51, which is still not 17.
Now let's try 69 - (18 + 34). This gives 69 - 52 = 17.
This seems to be the correct combination.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 17, 8, and 64. We need to create an equation that equals 55 using these numbers exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.

One way to approach this is to see if combining any two numbers in a specific way can get us closer to 55. If we add 8 and 64, we get 72. Now, if we subtract 17 from 72, we get 55. 
So, the equation would be: 64 + 8 - 17 = 55.

First, let's look at the numbers we have: 82, 56, and 61. We need to create an equation that equals 77 using each of these numbers only once.
Let's consider the difference between 82 and 61, which is 21. 
So, 82 - 61 = 21.
Now we need 56 plus something to get 77.
If we take 21 + 56 = 77, it works.
So the equation is: (82 - 61) + 56 = 77.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 22, 5, and 93. 
We need to create an equation that equals 76 using these numbers exactly once.
One effective strategy is to look for a combination of operations that can significantly reduce the numbers to reach 76.
We can see that if we use the subtraction operation, we might be able to reduce the numbers.
Let's try: 
93 - 22 = 71
Now we need to get from 71 to 76. 
If we consider adding 5, we get:
71 + 5 = 76
Therefore, the equation is 93 - 22 + 5 = 76.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 22) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 22, 5, and 93.
We need to form an equation that equals 76 using each number exactly once.
Let's try to combine these numbers through arithmetic operations.
If we subtract 5 from 22, we get 17.
Now our numbers are 17, 93, and 5.
Now we need to use these to get to 76.
If we add 93 and 5, we get 98.
Finally, if we subtract 17 from 98, we get 81, which is very close.
Given that 81 is still not 76, we need to think about the subtraction differently.
Instead of trying to subtract 17 twice in one step, let's see if we can get to 76 with just two operations.
If we take 93 and subtract it from 100 (which isn't one of our numbers but can be thought of as adding a 100 symbolically), we get 9.
And then adding that 9 to 5 gives us 14.
Finally, if we subtract 14 from 22, we get 8.
So, it seems the closest and simplest is achieving the number through additions and subtractions.
Therefore, the correct equation might be 93 + 5 - 22 = 76.
</think>
<answer> (93 + 5) - 22 </answer>

First, let's consider using the largest numbers to get closer to 38. The numbers 91 and 81 are close to 172. If we subtract 27 from 91, we get:
91 - 27 = 64
Now we need to get from 64 to 38, so we need to subtract 26. The only way to get 26 using the remaining numbers 1 and 81 is by adding 81 and then subtracting 65, but we only have 1 left, which can't make up the difference.
Considering other combinations, if we do:
81 - 1 = 80
And then:
80 - 27 = 53
Now, we need 15 less to reach 38 from 53. We can achieve this by:
53 - 35 = 18
And then:
18 - 1 = 17
And finally:
17 - 9 = 8
And then:
8 - 1 = 7
And finally:
7 - 3 = 4
And then:
4 - 1 = 3
And then:
3 - 2 = 1
And finally:
1 - 1 = 0
So, through a long series of operations, we can't directly achieve 38 with these numbers. Let's try another approach:
Using 91 and 81:
91 - 81 = 10
Now we need 28 to reach 38:
10 + 18 = 28
We can make 18 with 1 + 27 (since 1 is left).
So we have:
91 - 81 + 1 + 27 = 38

First, let's consider the numbers and the target result: 12, 74, and 42, aiming for a result of 20.
74 is quite large, so subtracting it from any of the others won't get us close to 20. 
12 and 42 are much smaller, but if we add them together, we get 54, which is too large.
Now, let's look at the multiplication and division options:
Multiplying 12 by 42 gives us 504, which is far from 20.
Dividing 74 by 12 gives us approximately 6.1667, which is also far from 20.
If we divide 42 by 12, we get 3.5, which still doesn't help.
Considering all these, it seems subtraction might be the way to go, but we need to find the right pair.
Subtract 12 from 42 and then subtract that result from 74.
42 - 12 = 30
74 - 30 = 44
This doesn't work either.
Let's reconsider: If we take 42 - 74, we get -32, which doesn't help.
Now, let's try: 74 - 42 = 32.
Then, 74 - 32 = 42, but we need 20.
It seems we need a different approach. 
Now, looking at the reverse approach: 12 + (74 - 42) should simplify to 20.
12 + (74 - 42) = 12 + 32 = 44, which doesn't work.
The only way left is to realize: 12 + (74 - 42) simplified should be 20.
12 + (74 - 42) = 12 + 32 - 42 = 12 - 8 = 4, not 20.
Observing all options again closely: Let's revise the last attempt properly: 74 - (42 + 12) gives 20.
42 + 12 = 54
74 - 54 = 20

We need to create an equation that equals 30 using each number exactly once.
73 and 19 when added or subtracted do not easily lead to 30, so let's try other combinations.
If we subtract 19 from 73, we get 54. 
Now, 54 minus 24 (6*4) equals 30.
So the equation becomes: (73 - 19) - (6 * 4) = 30.

Now we need 21 to reach 39 from 18.
We can use the remaining numbers to achieve this: 
18 + 21 = 39
So the equation is 35 - 17 + 21 = 39.

First, let's consider the numbers available: 91, 14, and 3.
We want to end up with the number 74.
Notice that 91 - 14 = 77, which is very close to 74.
If we use 91 - 14, we need a way to get from 77 to 74.
We can do this by subtracting 3 from 77.
So, the equation would be:
91 - 14 - 3 = 74
</think>
<answer> (91 - 14) - 3 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider what we need to do to reach 74 using the numbers 91, 14, and 3 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
- We see that 91 - 14 = 77.
- Now we need to get to 74 from 77, and we can do this by subtracting 3.
So, the equation would be: 91 - 14 - 3 = 74.
</think>
<answer> (91 - 14) - 3 </answer>

First, let's consider the numbers 47 and 59. Their sum is 106, which is close to 98. 
Next, let's see if we can adjust this sum to 98 by subtracting a smaller number. 
The number 8 is the smallest and easiest to subtract from 106. 
So, 106 - 8 = 98.
Therefore, we can use the equation: 47 + 59 - 8 = 98.
</think>
<answer> (47 + 59) - 8 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 71, 58, and 47. We need to use these exactly once to get 34 using basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to look for pairs of numbers that can be manipulated to get close to 34 and then adjust with the third number.
If we subtract 47 from 58, we get:
58 - 47 = 11
Now we need to use 71 and 11 to get 34. 
If we add 11 to 71, we get:
71 + 11 = 82
This is too high. So let's try subtracting 11 from 71 instead:
71 - 11 = 60
Now we need to get from 60 to 34. We can do this by subtracting 26. But 26 is not one of our numbers, so let's try another approach.
Given 71 - 11 = 60, we can now consider if we can get 60 - 26 or how we can use the available numbers effectively. Let's check another possibility:
If we try to combine the numbers differently, we can look at:
47 + 58 = 105
That's too big. So let's try breaking down 34 into parts involving our numbers.
Notice:
71 + 58 - 47 = 82 - 47 = 35
This is very close but one too high. We need to find a way to get to 34. 
We need a lower value with the same numbers, and we know:
71 - 47 = 24
We need an additional 8 (to reach 34 from 24), and since we can't combine 71 - 47 - 58, let's reevaluate:
71 - 47 + (58 - 47) = 24 + 11 = 35, which is again too much.
Trying again with combinations that fit:
71 - 58 = 13, then adding 21 (which we currently don't have) directly suggests a direct sum or subtraction isn't feasible.
Another possible path could relate:
47 + (71 - 58) / 2 = 14 (not 34), thus
(71 - 58) / 2 = 1 (not 34)
We reach:
(71 - 47) - (34 - 58/2) = 24 - (34 - 29) = 24 - 5 = 19 (not 34)
Thus, revising:
47 + 58 - (71 - 26) = 105 - 47 = 58 (exceeds 34)
Thus, revisiting, the simplest fitting combination feasible was:
71 - 47 + (58 - 26) = 24 + 32 = 56 (overshoots)
Final necessary:
71 - 47 + (58 - 26) = 24 + 32 = 56 (overshoots
Conclusion: incorrect forms, revisiting previous solution:
Thus:
58 - 11 = 47 + 26 - 71 = 34
Thus our answer is: 
58 - (71 - 47) = 34
</think>
<answer> 58 - (71 - 47) </answer>

First, let's consider the target number we want to reach: 67.
We have the numbers 34, 8, and 93 to use.
If we divide 93 by 8, we get 11.625. This is close to 12, but not quite there.
Instead, if we take 93 - 34 we get 59. 
Now, we need 67 - 59 = 8. 
So the equation becomes: 93 - 34 + 8 = 67.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 34) + 8 </answer>

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 6, 21, and 14.
To get 29, we can try different combinations of addition and subtraction.
If we use 21 - 6, we get 15.
Now, we need 14 more to reach 29, but 15 + 14 = 29 exactly.
So we can use the operation 21 - 6 + 14, which gives us 29.
</think>
<answer> (21 - 6) + 14 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 6, 21, and 14.
We need to create an equation that equals 29 using each number exactly once.
21 + 14 = 35 which is close to 29, but we need to reduce it.
If we subtract 6 from 35, we get 29.
So the equation we can form is: 21 + 14 - 6 = 29.
</think>
<answer> (21 + 14) - 6 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 50, 88, and 55. We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 93.
We can start by looking at the difference between 88 and 50, which is 38. So the equation might look something like this: 55 + (88 - 50) or (88 - 50) + 55.
Calculating both options:
1. 55 + (88 - 50) = 55 + 38 = 93
2. (88 - 50) + 55 = 38 + 55 = 93
Both options give us the desired result of 93.
</think>
<answer> 55 + (88 - 50) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider all possible combinations of the numbers 46, 25, 43, and 73 using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One promising combination could be: 
(73 - 46) + 25 - 43
(73 - 46) is 27, 
27 + 25 is 52,
52 - 43 is 9.
This is not the correct result, so let's try a different combination.
Another approach could be:
(73 - 43) - 25 + 46
73 - 43 is 30,
30 - 25 is 5,
5 + 46 is 51.
This is still not correct. 
However, if we try:
(46 + 25) - (43 - 73)
46 + 25 is 71,
43 - 73 is -30,
71 - (-30) is 71 + 30 which equals 101.
This is way too high.
Finally, let's try:
(46 + 43) - 73 + 25
46 + 43 is 89,
89 - 73 is 16,
16 + 25 is 41.
This is still off.
After trying various combinations, the correct solution seems to be:
(73 + 25) - 46 - 43
73 + 25 is 98,
98 - 46 is 52,
52 - 43 is 9.
This is still not correct.
Let's try:
(73 - 43) + (25 - 46)
73 - 43 is 30,
25 - 46 is -21,
30 + (-21) is 9.
This is still not the target result.
The correct combination is:
(73 + 25 - 46) - 43
73 + 25 is 98,
98 - 46 is 52,
52 - 43 is 9.
This is still not the correct final answer.
Finally, after a few incorrect trails, we find:
(73 - 46) - (25 - 43)
73 - 46 is 27,
25 - 43 is -18,
27 - (-18) is 27 + 18 is 45.
Now we have found the correct equation.

<think> 
We have the numbers 26, 26, and 62. We need to use these numbers exactly once along with basic arithmetic operations to get the result 62.
First, let's see if we can combine 26 and 26 in some way:
26 + 26 = 52
This doesn't work because we need 62.
Next, let's try multiplying:
26 * 26 = 676
This is too large, so we can't use this.
Now let's consider division:
26 / 26 = 1
This is also not what we want.
Finally, let's try subtracting:
62 - 26 = 36 (this is not using the second 26)
62 - 26 - 26 = 62 - 52 = 10 (this is also not what we want)
None of the combinations using subtraction are working either.
We can rearrange the subtraction equation:
26 + 26 = 52
62 - 52 = 10
This doesn't give us our target either. We're missing a way to reduce from 62. 
So, let's combine the 26's again:
26 + 26 = 52
This doesn't work as is.
We need to use the second 26 in a different way to get to 62.
Let's try 26 + 62 - 26 = 62. Here we are using the second 26 in the correct way.
</think>
<answer> (26 + 62) - 26 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 26, 3, and 70. We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 93.
- Adding 70 and 26 gives us 96, which is close to 93 but a bit too high.
- We need to decrease the sum by 3 to get to 93.
- The number 3 is available, so we can subtract 3 from 70 + 26.
Therefore, the equation is: 70 + 26 - 3 = 93.

<answer> (70 + 26) - 3 </answer>

First, let's consider the target number we want to reach: 91.
We have the numbers 45, 92, 7, and 37.
If we look at 92, it's quite close to 91, so we can subtract 1 to get 91.
92 - 1 = 91.
Now, we need to find a way to get the 1 using the other numbers. 
One possibility is to use 7 and 37, since 7 + 37 = 44, and then we can get 1 from 45 by subtracting 44.
So, 7 + 37 = 44 and 45 - 44 = 1.
Therefore, 92 - (45 - (7 + 37)) = 91.
</think>
<answer> (92 - (45 - (7 + 37))) </answer>

First, let's consider the target number: 75.
We need to use the numbers 83, 41, 5, and 38 exactly once.
Looking at the numbers, we notice that 83 - 41 = 42.
Now we need 33 more to reach 75 (because 42 + 33 = 75).
Looking at the remaining numbers, 38 - 5 = 33.
So we can use 83 - 41 + (38 - 5) which equals 75.
</think>
<answer> (83 - 41) + (38 - 5) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the target number we want to reach: 68.
We have the numbers 1, 75, and 6 available.
75 is quite close to 68, so we can subtract 75 from 68 and see what's left:
68 - 75 = -7
-7 is not helpful here, so we need to use 75 in a different way.
Considering 6 is a small number, we can try to multiply it with another number to get closer to 68.
If we multiply 6 by 2, we get 12, which is not 68.
If we multiply 6 by 12, we get 72, which is also not 68.
If we consider using division, 75 divided by 6 gives us 12.5, which is not an integer.
Instead, let's try to create an expression using 1, 75, and 6.
If we use 75 - 6 = 69, we can then subtract 1 to get to 68.
So, (75 - 6) - 1 = 68.
</think>
<answer> (75 - 6) - 1 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's evaluate the possible combinations of the numbers 59, 24, and 52 using basic arithmetic operations.
One approach is to use subtraction and addition:
- We can try 59 - 24 + 52
- Let's calculate this: 
  59 - 24 = 35
  Now add 52 to this result: 
  35 + 52 = 87
  
This doesn't work since it doesn't equal 31. 
Let's try another combination:
- We can try 59 - (24 + 52)
- Let's calculate this:
  24 + 52 = 76
  Now subtract from 59:
  59 - 76 = -17

This also doesn't work.
Now let's try:
- Using the numbers in a different way: (59 + 52) - 24
- Let's calculate this:
  59 + 52 = 111
  Now subtract 24:
  111 - 24 = 87

This doesn't equal 31 either.
Finally:
- We can try (52 - 24) + 59
- Let's calculate this:
  52 - 24 = 28
  Now add 59 to this:
  28 + 59 = 87

This doesn't equal 31.
After some trials, we find:
- Another way is: (59 + 24 - 52)
- Let's calculate this:
  59 + 24 = 83
  Now subtract 52:
  83 - 52 = 31

This does work and equals 31.
</think>
<answer> (59 + 24 - 52) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, I need to find an equation that uses the numbers 59, 24, and 52 to equal 31.
59 - 24 = 35, which is close but too high.
59 - 52 = 7, which is too low.
If we try 59 - (52 - 24) = 59 - 24 = 35, but we need 31.
Now let's try another combination: 59 - 24 - 52 = 59 - 76 = -17, which is still not 31.
52 - 24 = 28 (this is too big)
52 - (59 - 24) = 52 - 35 = 17 (this is too low)
Let's try: (52 - 24) + 59 - 52 = 28 + 59 - 52 = 87 - 52 = 35, that's not working.
We can try another combination: (59 - 52) + 24 = 7 + 24 = 31.
This gives us the equation: (59 - 52) + 24 = 31.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 34, 62, and 9.
We need to form an equation using these numbers exactly once and get the result of 37.
Let's try adding some numbers:
34 + 62 = 96
This is too large, so we can't use both 34 and 62.
Now let's try 34 - 62:
34 - 62 = -28
This is too small.
Let's try 62 - 34:
62 - 34 = 28
This is still too small.
Now let's look at including 9:
34 + 9 = 43
This is a bit larger than 37.
We need to try 62 - 34 - 9:
62 - 34 - 9 = 19
This is still too small.
Now let's try 62 - 34 + 9:
62 - 34 + 9 = 37
This gives us the desired result of 37.
So the equation is 62 - 34 + 9.

First, let's consider all the possible combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with the numbers 58, 12, and 6.
- Trying subtraction: 58 - 12 - 6 = 30, which is not 52.
- Trying addition: 58 + 12 + 6 = 76, which is not 52.
- Trying multiplication and division: (58 * 6) / 12 = 34.5, which is not an integer and not 52.
The first few combinations have not worked, so let's try combining operations differently.
Let's try: 58 - 6 + 12 = 52.
58 - 6 = 52, then 52 + 12 = 64, which is incorrect.
We should've tried: 58 - (6 + 12) = 58 - 18 = 40, which is also not 52.
Let's try combining addition and subtraction: 58 - 12 + 6 = 48, which is still not 52.
So far, using the basic operations and numbers provided, it seems we are not getting 52. Let's re-evaluate the combinations:
One possible correct solution: 
(58 + 12) - 6 = 70 - 6 = 64, which is still incorrect.
But another correct solution is: 
(58 - 12) + 6 = 46 + 6 = 52.
Therefore, the correct equation using 58, 12, and 6 to get 52 is: (58 - 12) + 6 = 52.

First, we need to create an equation that equals 36 using the numbers 66, 27, 9, and 6. Let's try different combinations:
- 66 - 27 = 39 (not 36)
- 66 - 9 = 57 (not 36)
- 66 - 6 = 60 (not 36)
- 66 / 2 = 33 (not 36)
- 66 / 1. 1 = 60 (not 36)
- 66 / 3 = 22 (not 36)
We need to use all numbers. Let's try combining smaller numbers:
- 27 + 9 = 36
Now we need to use 66 and 6 to make 36. If we look back at our trial, 27 + 9 = 36, so we need 66 / 6 = 11 which doesn't work.
This seems tricky, let's try combining other ways:
- 66 + 6 = 72 (not 36)
- 66 - 27 = 39 (not 36)
- 66 / 9 = 7. 33 (not 36)
- 9 * 4 = 36 but 4 is not from our list of numbers.
Trying to fit 9 into other combinations:
27 + 6 = 33 (not 36)
66 / 2 = 33 (not 36)
Finally, we try:
66 - 27 - 9 = 27 (not 36)
18 doesn't equal 36.
Let's recombine and simplify:
66 - 27 = 39
9 + 6 = 15
No pure calculation seems right now, give other ways, revisiting:
18 (not found).
Let's try negative or dissimilar signs:
66 * 1 - 27 = 39
Trying different:
66 - 27 - 6 = 33 (not 36)
Revisit positive:
9 * 4 = 36
No target.
Therefore, recombine numbers carefully:
66 - 27 - (9 - 6) = 36
Attempts maximum.
Final check groups:
(66 - 27) - (9 - 6) = 36
(27 + 9) + (66 - 6) = 36
Final:
3 (66 - 27) - 9 + 6 = 36.

First, we need to create an equation that equals 89 using the numbers 77, 55, and 67 exactly once. Let's try different combinations using basic arithmetic operations.
- We can start by trying to see if we can get close to 89 with any pair of these numbers and then see what additional operation or number we need.
- 77 + 55 = 132 (too high)
- 77 + 67 = 144 (too high)
- 55 + 67 = 122 (too high)
- 77 - 67 = 11 (too low)
- 67 - 55 = 12 (too low)
- 55 - 67 = -12 (not positive)
- 77 / 67 (approx 1. 15) or 67 / 55 (approx 1. 22) are not integers and won't help us make 89.
- Now, let's see if we can use multiplication or any combination of these:
- 77 * 55 / 67 (or something similar) might work:
  77 * 55 = 4235
  4235 / 67 = 63 (still too low)
  We need to find a way to adjust this to 89.
- Finally, let's try: 
  77 + 55 - 67 = 67 (too low again)
- Checking again, I found a solution by combining them:
  67 + 55 - 77 = 43 (still not 89)
- After checking every combination:
  67 + 77 - 55 = 89

First, we need to create an equation that equals 92 using the numbers 52, 98, and 46 exactly once. 
If we look at the numbers, we notice that 98 is quite close to 92, so we might want to subtract or add it to get close to 92.
Let's consider the equation: 98 - 46 + 52.
First, 98 - 46 = 52.
Then, 52 + 52 = 104.
This doesn't work since it doesn't give us 92. 
Instead, we can try a different order: 98 - 52 + 46.
First, 98 - 52 = 46.
Then, 46 + 46 = 92.
This gives us the correct result of 92.

We can start by looking at 62 and 7. Their sum is 69, which is close to 63 but in the right direction.
Now, we subtract 6 from 69 to get 63.
So the equation becomes: (62 + 7) - 6 = 63.

69 - 39 = 30
So we're looking for a way to use 30 and the remaining numbers (61 and 18) to get 13.
61 - 18 = 43
This gives us 43 - 30 = 13.
Therefore, one way to achieve 13 is by using the equation (61 - 18) - (69 - 39).

- 98 - 66 = 32 (too low)
- 93 - 66 = 27 (too low)
Now, let's try adding some numbers: 
- 98 + 66 = 164 (too high)
- 93 + 66 = 159 (too high)
Next, let's try different operations:
- (98 - 66) + 93 = 32 + 93 = 125 (too high)
- (98 + 66) - 93 = 164 - 93 = 71 (this works)
Therefore, we can use the equation: (98 + 66) - 93 = 71.

We can start by looking at the largest number, 47, and see if we can reach 10 by adding or subtracting the other numbers.
33 - 23 = 10
Now we have two more numbers: 47 and 10.
We can add 47 and 10:
47 + 10 = 57

21 - 13 = 8
Now we have 8 and 2 left.
2 + 8 = 10
But this isn't 16.
Let's try another combination:
We know 21 - 13 = 8, so if we use 2 as part of the equation, we can try:
2 * 8 = 16
And this equals 16.
</think>
<answer> (2 * (21 - 13)) </answer>

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 59, 29, 35, and 12.
We need to use these numbers with basic arithmetic operations to reach 77.
Let's try combining 59 and 12 first:
59 + 12 = 71
We're only 6 away from 77, so let's check if we can get that with the remaining numbers 29 and 35.
35 - 29 = 6
Now we have:
59 + 12 + (35 - 29) = 59 + 12 + 6 = 77
So the equation that equals 77 is 59 + 12 + (35 - 29).
</think>
<answer> (59 + 12) + (35 - 29) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider how we can combine these numbers to get 11. 
One approach is to use subtraction to get closer to 11. 
We have the numbers 8 and 72. If we subtract 72 from 8, we get -68, which is too far from 11.
Next, let's try adding or subtracting 53 with the remaining numbers.
If we take 72 - 53 = 19, which is still not 11.
Trying another combination, we can use 8 - 53 = -45, which is not useful.
Now let's try multiplication and addition/subtraction in different orders.
If we use the equation: (8 - 53 / 72)
First, 53 / 72 is approximately 0.74 (rounded for simplicity), then 8 - 0.74 = 7.26 (approx), which is close to 11.
However, trying multiplication:
8 * 72 = 576, which is much too large.
Considering the numbers again, a direct subtraction looks promising:
8 - 72 - 53 = -80, which is too negative.
Checking another possibility: 
72 - 8 - 53 = 11, this works.
So the final equation is 72 - 8 - 53 = 11.
</think>
<answer> (72 - 8 - 53) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's evaluate the given numbers: 8, 72, and 53.
We need to create an equation that equals 11 using each number exactly once.
72 * 53 = 3816, which is far from 11.
8 * 53 = 424, also far from 11.
Now, let's try 8 * 72 / 53. However, 8 * 72 = 576, which is also not close to 11.
Next, let's try 72 - 53 = 19, which is still not 11.
Finally, let's try 72 - 8 - 53. This gives us:
72 - 8 = 64,
64 - 53 = 11.
So, the equation 72 - 8 - 53 equals 11.
</think>
<answer> (72 - 8) - 53 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 66, 7, 14, and 21.
We need to find an expression using these numbers exactly once that equals 80.
If we look at 66 and 14, we can get 66 - 14 = 52.
Now we need 28 more to make 80, because 52 + 28 = 80.
Next, 21 is a good candidate because 21 + 7 = 28.
So we have: 66 - 14 + 21 + 7 = 80.
</think>
<answer> (66 - 14) + 21 + 7 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 40, 63, and 29.
We need to create an equation that equals 74 using each number exactly once.
Let's start with subtraction: 
63 - 29 = 34
Now we have 34 and 40 left.
We can add 34 and 40:
34 + 40 = 74
So the equation is 63 - 29 + 40 = 74.
</think>
<answer> (63 - 29) + 40 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 43, and 68.
We need to create an equation that equals 14 using each number exactly once.
Let's start by looking at simple operations:
- Multiplying and dividing 11, 43, and 68 doesn't seem to work to reach 14.
- Adding and subtracting these numbers also doesn't seem to yield 14.
Now let's try different combinations:
11 + 43 = 54
68 - 43 = 25
- 11 - 25 = -14, which works as an equation that equals 14.
Thus, 11 - (68 - 43) = 11 - 25 = -14. But we need 14, not -14.
Let's try another combination:
68 - 43 = 25
11 + 25 = 36
This doesn't work either.
After trying different combinations, it seems like we might need to rethink our approach. Let's try addition and subtraction differently:
11 + (43 - 68) = 11 - 25 = -14. Still not 14.
The only combination that works correctly is: 
68 - 11 - 43 = 57 - 43 = 14
</think>
<answer> (68 - 11) - 43 </answer>

First, let's list the numbers we have: 51, 94, and 48.
We need to create an equation that equals 91 using these numbers exactly once.
Let's try different combinations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If we subtract 48 from 51, we get 51 - 48 = 3.
Now, if we add 94 to this result, we get: 3 + 94 = 97, which is too high.
Let's try some other combinations.
If we add 48 to 51, we get 51 + 48 = 99, which is also too high.
Now, let's try subtracting 51 from 94: 94 - 51 = 43.
If we add 48 to this result, we get: 43 + 48 = 91, which is exactly what we need.
So the equation becomes: (94 - 51) + 48 = 91.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 51) + 48 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 32, 44, and 97.
We need to create an equation that equals 85 using these numbers exactly once.
If we look at the numbers, 97 is quite close to 85, so let's consider subtracting it from something.
44 + 32 = 76, which is not 85.
Subtracting 32 from 97 would give us 65, and then adding 44 still doesn't get us to 85.
Now, let's try 97 - 32 and then use 44 in another way:
97 - 32 = 65
65 + 44 = 109, which is too large.
We need to rethink how to use these numbers to get exactly 85. 
How about we try 97 - 44:
97 - 44 = 53
Now we need 32 more to reach 85, so:
53 + 32 = 85
This works because we used each number only once.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 44) + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 76, 44, and 62.
We need to create an equation that equals 94 using these numbers once.
Subtracting 44 from 76 gives us 32 (76 - 44 = 32).
Now we have two numbers left: 32 and 62.
If we add 62 to 32, we get 94 (32 + 62 = 94).
So the equation would be 76 - 44 + 62 = 94.
</think>
<answer> (76 - 44) + 62 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers given: 55, 31, and 93. We need to create an equation that equals 69 using these numbers only once.
We can start by looking at the numbers and trying to combine them in a way that results in 69.
One way to approach this is to try adding and subtracting combinations of these numbers.
If we subtract 31 from 55, we get 24.
If we then add 93 to 24, we get 117, which is too high.
We can try another combination: If we subtract 55 from 93, we get 38.
If we then add 31 to 38, we get 69.
So, the equation would be: 93 - 55 + 31 = 69.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 55) + 31 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, we need to use the numbers 55, 31, and 93 to make 69. Let's try to combine them in different ways using basic arithmetic operations.
- We can try addition and subtraction: 55 + 31 - 93 = 86 - 93 = -7 (not 69)
- Next, let's try multiplication and addition: 55 * 31 / 93 = 1685 / 93 = 18. 34 (not 69)
- Now, let's try subtraction and division: (93 - 55) / 31 = 38 / 31 = 1. 22 (not 69)
- Lastly, let's try 55 + (93 - 31) = 55 + 62 = 117 (not 69)
After testing these combinations, it seems none directly work. However, we should check for other possibilities.
- Let's try 93 - 55 + 31: 93 - 55 + 31 = 38 + 31 = 69
This combination gives us 69.
</think>
<answer> (93 - 55) + 31 </answer>

<think> 
We need to create an equation using the numbers 66, 67, and 74 that equals 59. We can try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider the possible combinations:
1. 74 - 66 + 67
This gives us:
74 - 66 = 8
8 + 67 = 75
This doesn't give us 59.
2. 74 - (66 + 67)
This gives us:
66 + 67 = 133
74 - 133 = -59
This gives us the required result (-59), but we need 59.
3. 67 + (74 - 66)
This gives us:
74 - 66 = 8
8 + 67 = 75
This doesn't give us 59.
The only viable option left is a permutation of the above:
67 + (74 - 66) = 67 + 8 = 75
That is not correct, so we need to rethink it.
Let's try:
(74 - 66) + 67 = 8 + 67 = 75
This isn't the number we're looking for. We need to rearrange:
67 + (74 - 66) = 67 + 8 = 75
We need to get 59, so:
67 - (74 - 66) = 67 - 8 = 59
Thus, the equation that works is 67 - (74 - 66) = 59.
</think>
<answer> (67 - (74 - 66)) </answer>

==============
<think> 
We need to create an equation using the numbers 66, 67, and 74 that equals 59. Each number can only be used once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 74 - 67 = 7
- 7 - 66 = -59 (This works, but we need positive 59)
We need to adjust our approach.
- 74 + 66 = 140
- 140 - 67 = 73
- This is too high.
- Let's try 74 + 67 = 141
- 141 - 66 = 75
- This is also too high.
- Let's try 74 - 66 = 8
- 8 + 67 = 75
- Still too high.
Let's try:
- 67 + 66 = 133
- 133 - 74 = 59
This seems to work. Each number is used exactly once.

<answer> (67 + 66) - 74 </answer>

<think> 
First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 32 and 32, and results in 91.
We can start by adding 32 and 32:
32 + 32 = 64
Now we need to get from 64 to 91.
We can do this by adding 27 to 64:
64 + 27 = 91
To get 27, we can use the number 91 by subtracting 32:
91 - 32 = 59
Then we need to add another 18 to get to 27:
59 - 32 = 27 (this step is incorrect, let's correct it)
We should get 18 from 32 - (91 - 32):
32 - (91 - 32) = 32 - 59 = -27 (This is not helping, let's think differently)
We can actually subtract 32 from 91:
91 - 32 = 59
And then add 32 to get to 91:
59 + 32 = 91
So the correct equation is:
91 - 32 + 32 = 91
</think>
<answer> (91 - 32) + 32 </answer>

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 19, 15, and 27. We need to use these once each to get a result of 61.
- If we add 27 and 15, we get 42.
- Now we need 19 more to reach 61.
- So we use 19 to add to 42: 42 + 19 = 61.
This seems to work, and we used each number exactly once.
</think>
<answer> (27 + 15) + 19 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 11, 35, and 4.
We need to use these numbers along with basic arithmetic operations to get 20.
If we look at the numbers, 35 and 4 are close to 39 and 4, and 11 is 7 less than 18.
35 - 4 = 31
Now, we need to get from 31 to 20, by using 11.
So, 31 - 11 = 20.
Therefore, the equation is 35 - 4 - 11 = 20.
</think>
<answer> (35 - 4) - 11 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 84, 53, 78, 66.
We need to form an equation that equals 19 using each number exactly once.
One way to start is to look at the smaller numbers; 66 - 53 = 13. 
This brings us closer to our target of 19.
Next, we need 6 more to reach 19.
Now, we're left with 84 and 78.
If we take 78 - 84, we get -6, which won't help us reach 19.
So, let's try another combination.
We need a way to create 6 more from the remaining numbers.
One possible way is 84 - 78 = 6.
Now we have all the required parts: 66 - 53 = 13, and 84 - 78 = 6.
So, we can form the equation: 66 - 53 + (84 - 78) = 19.
Let's check:
66 - 53 = 13
84 - 78 = 6
13 + 6 = 19.
This satisfies our condition.

First, let's look at the numbers we have: 92, 7, and 58.
We need to create an equation that equals 41 using these numbers only once.
We can start by considering subtraction:
92 - 58 = 34
This gives us 34, which is not 41.
Now let's try combining other operations:
92 - 58 + 7 = 41
This gives us 41, which is what we need.
So the equation is 92 - 58 + 7.

<think> 
First, let's look at the numbers we have: 69, 90, and 68. We need to create an equation that equals 89 using these numbers exactly once.
One approach is to try adding and subtracting combinations of these numbers.
90 - 69 = 21
This doesn't give us 89, so let's try other combinations.
Let's try: 
69 + 68 - 90
69 + 68 - 90 = 137 - 90 = 47
This is still not 89. 
Next, let's try:
90 - 68 + 69
90 - 68 + 69 = 22 + 69 = 91
This is close, but not exactly 89.
The final combination seems to be:
90 - 69 - 68 + 69
90 - 69 - 68 + 69 
= 11 - 68 + 69 
= -57 + 69 
= 12
We need to adjust this to get 89. 
69 + (90 - 68) = 69 + 22 = 91
We already have close.
90 - 69 + 68 = 90 - 69 + 68 = 21 + 68 = 89
So the correct equation is:
90 - 69 + 68 = 89
</think>
<answer> (90 - 69) + 68 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 69, 90, and 68.
We need to create an equation that equals 89 using these numbers only once.
If we look at the numbers, we can see that 90 - 69 = 21.
Now we need 69 - 21 to reach 89, but we only have 68 left.
So, let's try using division: 69 - 21 = 48, and then 48 / 68 doesn't work.
Now, let's try another combination: 90 - 69 = 21.
We need to get to 89, so we can try 90 - 69 - 68 / (not available), but we need to form 89.
Considering all, using 90 - 69 = 21 and then manipulating it, we should reconsider the order.
Reconsidering again, we get 90 - (69 - 68) which simplifies to 90 - 1 = 89.

First, let's list out all the potential combinations using the given operations:
- Addition: 25 + 72 - 59 = 38
- Subtraction: 72 - 25 - 59 = -12
- Multiplication: There are no pairs of numbers that result in 38 when multiplied.
- Division: There are no pairs of numbers that result in 38 when divided.

We see that 25 + 72 - 59 equals 38.
</think>
<answer> (25 + 72) - 59 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers: 25, 72, and 59.
We need to use these numbers to get a result of 38.
We can try different combinations of operations.
If we look at 72 - 59 = 13, we have 25 left.
Then, we need 38, and we currently have 13.
Adding these together: 13 + 25 = 38.
Therefore, the equation is 72 - 59 + 25 = 38.

First, let's list out the numbers we have: 36, 28, and 34.
We need to use these numbers exactly once to get an equation that equals 30.
Let's start by trying to see if any of these numbers can be combined in a straightforward way:
- 36 - 28 = 8 (not 30)
- 36 - 34 = 2 (not 30)
- 36 + 28 = 64 (not 30)
- 34 + 28 = 62 (not 30)
- 36 + 34 = 70 (not 30)
- 28 + 34 = 62 (not 30)
We haven't had success yet, so let's try to combine smaller parts of these numbers in different ways:
- 34 - 28 = 6
Now, if we take 36 and subtract 6:
- 36 - 6 = 30
This gives us the result we need.
So the equation is 36 - (34 - 28) = 30.
</think>
<answer> (36 - (34 - 28)) </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 19, 94, and 42. We need to create an equation that equals 33 using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
One way to approach this is to look for a combination that might break down to our target number. 
Notice that 94 - 42 = 52. This gives us a significant number we can manipulate. Now we need 89 - 52 = 37, but we can't use 89.
However, if we subtract 52 from 94, we get 42. So the equation becomes 42 + 19 = 61.
We need to subtract some value to get to 33 instead of 61. So, let's try 61 - 28 = 33, and notice 94 - 42 = 52, so 52 - 19 = 33, which fits our requirement.
Therefore, the equation will be 94 - 42 - 19 = 33.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 42) - 19 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers and basic operations. We need to get to 33 using 19, 94, and 42 exactly once.
One approach is to try combinations of operations with these numbers.
If we try subtraction:
94 - 19 = 75
This is close but too high.
Let's try combining other operations:
42 + 19 = 61
Again, this is too high.
Next, let's try multiplication and addition/subtraction:
94 - 42 = 52
52 - 19 = 33
This gives us the result we want.
So, the equation is:
94 - 42 - 19 = 33

<answer> (94 - 42) - 19 </answer>

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 52, 22, and 66.
We need to create an expression that equals 36 using each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 66 - 52 = 14 (This is not 36)
- 66 - 22 = 44 (This is not 36)
- 52 - 22 = 30 (This is not 36)
- 66 - (52 - 22) = 66 - 30 = 36 (This works)
So, the equation we get is 66 - (52 - 22) = 36.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 61, 70, and 71 that equals 62. 
One approach is to start by looking at the numbers and trying to see if we can get close to 62 using basic operations.
71 - 70 = 1
62 - 1 = 61
Adding 61 back would give us the number we are looking for.
So the equation would be: 71 - 70 + 61 = 62
</think>
<answer> (71 - 70) + 61 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 89, 80, and 83. Our target is to create an equation that equals 92 using each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.
We can start by looking at the differences and sums:
- 89 - 83 = 6
- 89 - 80 = 9
- 80 - 83 = -3 (not useful as we need positive numbers)
- 89 + 80 = 169
- 80 + 83 = 163
We see that 92 is close to 89 and if we subtract 80, we get 92.
So the equation would be: 89 - 80 = 9, but we want 92. We can adjust this by adding 83 to 9, but we need to do this in a way that uses all numbers exactly once. Instead, we use the reverse approach: 89 - 80 + 83.
Let's verify:
89 - 80 + 83 = 9 + 83 = 92
</think>
<answer> (89 - 80) + 83 </answer>

To form an equation that equals 86 using the numbers 2, 28, and 56, one approach is to consider how to use addition or subtraction to reach 86.
First, let's look at the sum of 28 and 56:
28 + 56 = 84
This gives us a result of 84, which is 2 less than 86. 
So, to make it 86, we need to add 2 to 84:
84 + 2 = 86
Thus, the equation using all three numbers only once is:
56 + 28 + 2 = 86
</think>

First, we need to create an equation that equals 38 using the numbers 32, 88, and 94. 
Let's start by looking at the components of the target number (38):
- 38 can be broken down into parts that might help us use the given numbers.
We can consider subtraction and addition:
94 - 88 = 6
Now, we need to reduce 6 to get to 38. 
We know 32 + 6 = 38
So, combining these components, we get:
(94 - 88) + 32 = 38
</think>
<answer> (94 - 88) + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 32, 88, and 94.
We need to use each number exactly once to get a result of 38.
Let's try combinations of addition and subtraction:
- If we subtract 32 from 88, we get 56. Then subtracting 28 (94 - 32) from 56 does not get us 38.
- If we subtract 32 from 94, we get 62. Then subtracting 40 (88 - 48) from 62 also doesn't give us 38.
- If we try combining addition and subtraction differently, like (94 - 32) - 88 might not help.
- Let's try multiplication and subtraction: 
  - Multiplying 88 by 4 gives 352, which is too large.
  - Multiplying 88 by 1 gives 88. Then subtracting 50 (94 - 32) from 88 also doesn't give us 38.
- Another approach could be: 
  - Subtracting 46 from 94 first gives 48. Then we need to get from 48 to 38 using the remaining 32.
  - Subtracting 10 from 48 gives 38. 
So, the equation could be: 94 - 32 - (88 - 50)
But this approach uses '50' which is not a number we have.
So, let's go back and re-evaluate each number alone and in pairs:
- If we take 94 - 88, we get 6. Then try adding 32 to it:
  - 6 + 32 = 38
This works. Therefore, the equation is 94 - 88 + 32 equals 38.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 88) + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 32, 88, and 94.
We need to use these numbers once each to make an equation that equals 38.
One way to approach this is to start by looking at the difference between 94 and 88, which is 6. 
Then, we need to make up the remaining 32 to get to 38. 
We can subtract 32 from 6, but this doesn't work because we can't use the number 6 separately from the other numbers. 
However, if we consider combining 88 and 32, we can subtract a number. 
88 - 94 + 32 works since 88 - 94 equals -6 and -6 + 32 equals 26, not 38.
Instead, let's try another combination: 
94 - 88 + 32 = 6 + 32 = 38.
</think>
<answer> (94 - 88) + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 26, 7, and 13.
We want to create an expression that equals 32 using each number only once.
Let's try combining them with basic arithmetic operations.
26 - 13 = 13
Now, we need 19 more to reach 32.
We have 7 left, and 19 - 7 = 12.
So we need something to get from 12 to 19.
13 + 7 = 20, which is too large.
If we use 13 - 7 = 6, we need 16 more.
We can achieve 16 from 26 - 10, but 10 isn't in our set.
Instead, let's consider 26 - 13 = 13 and then combining it with other values.
We see that:
26 - 13 = 13
13 + 7 = 20
But we need 12 more.
So let's think of another combination using only the numbers given:
13 + 7 = 20
26 - 20 = 6
We need 26 - 13 + 7
26 - 13 = 13
13 + 7 = 20
But we need exactly 32.
Another trial: 
26 - 7 = 19
And then we need 13 more.
The equation that works is:
26 - 7 = 19
And 19 + 13 = 32
So the correct equation is 26 - 7 + 13.
</think>
<answer> (26 - 7) + 13 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 80, 68, and 65.
We need to create an equation that equals 53 using each number exactly once.
We can try different combinations and operations.
If we subtract 68 from 80, we get 12.
Now we have 12 and 65 left.
If we subtract 65 from 12, we get -53, which isn't what we want.
Multiplying and dividing these numbers by each other also don't seem to work to get 53.
Let's try adding and subtracting in a different order.
If we add 65 and 68, we get 133.
Now we have 80 and 133.
We need to subtract 80 from 133 to get 53.
So the equation would be: (65 + 68) - 80 = 53.
</think>
<answer> (65 + 68) - 80 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 19, 44, and 23.
We need to create an equation that equals 48 using these numbers exactly once.
44 - 19 = 25
This leaves us with 23 to add to 25 to get to 48.
25 + 23 = 48
So the equation is 44 - 19 + 23 = 48.
</think>
<answer> (44 - 19) + 23 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's look at the numbers we have: 58, 38, and 22. We need to use these numbers to create an equation that equals 42.
Let's try different combinations:
- If we use 58 and 38, their sum is 96, and subtracting 22 gives us 74, which is too high.
- Trying 58 and 22, we get 80, and then subtracting 38 gives us 42.
This combination seems promising. Therefore, the equation is 58 + 22 - 38 = 42.
</think>
<answer> (58 + 22) - 38 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers [43, 28, 29]. We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 100.
A good starting point is to look for combinations that might add up to a number close to 100. 28 + 29 = 57. Now, we need 43 more to reach 100.
Notice that 100 - (28 + 29) = 43. This means we can use the formula: 100 = (28 + 29) + 43.
</think>
<answer> (28 + 29) + 43 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 68, 45, 45.
We need to form an equation that equals 22 using these numbers exactly once.
One way to approach this is to look for combinations of the numbers that, when combined with arithmetic operations, can result in 22.
Let's try subtracting 45 from 68 first: 
68 - 45 = 23
This is close but not 22. 
Now, let's try adding 45 to this result:
23 + 45 = 68
Still not 22.
Let's try another approach:
45 + (68 - 45) = 45 + 23 = 68
This isn't what we want either.
Trying different pairings:
45 - (68 - 45) = 45 - 23 = 22
This gives us the result we need.
So the equation is 45 - (68 - 45) = 22.
</think>
<answer> (45 - (68 - 45)) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, we need to use the numbers 68, 45, and 45 to get 22. 
Let's start by adding 45 and 45:
45 + 45 = 90
Now we have 68 and 90. If we subtract 68 from 90, we get:
90 - 68 = 22
So, the equation using the numbers 68, 45, and 45 to get 22 is:
(45 + 45) - 68
</think>
<answer> (45 + 45) - 68 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 20, 35, and 32.
We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 17.
One way to approach this is to think about which numbers can be subtracted or added to reach 17.
If we subtract 32 from 35, we get 3 (35 - 32 = 3).
Now we need to use 20 and the result of 3 (i.e., 3) to make 17.
If we subtract 3 from 20, we get 17 (20 - 3 = 17).
So the equation becomes: 20 - (35 - 32) = 17.
</think>
<answer> (20 - (35 - 32)) </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 54, 96, 75, and 87.
We need to create an equation that equals 30 using each number exactly once.
We can start by looking at the numbers and trying to form pairs that add up or subtract to get closer to 30.
75 + 54 = 129 (This is too high)
96 - 75 = 21 (This is a bit lower but close)
87 - 54 = 33 (This is too high)
96 - 54 = 42 (This is too high)
Let's try another approach:
96 - 87 = 9
Now we have 9, 54, and 75 left. 
75 - 54 = 21 (9 + 21 = 30)
So we can use:
(96 - 87) + (75 - 54) = 30
</think>
<answer> (96 - 87) + (75 - 54) </answer>

==============
<think> 
We need to use the numbers 15, 27, and 8 exactly once to get an equation that equals 20.
First, let's consider if we can use only addition and subtraction:
15 + 27 = 42 (too high)
15 + 8 = 23 (too high)
27 + 8 = 35 (too high)
15 - 27 = -12 (too low)
27 - 15 = 12 (too low)
8 - 15 = -7 (too low)

Now, let's try multiplication and division:
15 * 8 = 120 (too high)
27 * 8 = 216 (too high)
15 / 8 = 1.875 (not an integer, so not valid)
27 / 8 = 3.375 (not an integer, so not valid)

Finally, let's try a combination of all operations:
15 - (27 / 8) = 15 - 3.375 = 11.625 (not 20)
15 - (8 / 27) = 15 - 0.296 (not 20)
Let's try another combination:
(27 - 8) / 15 = 19 / 15 (not 20)
(27 + 8) / 15 = 35 / 15 (not 20)
(27 - 8) + 15 = 19 + 15 = 34 (not 20)
15 + (27 - 8) = 15 + 19 = 34 (not 20)

It seems we've exhausted all combinations. Let's try another straightforward approach:
27 - 15 = 12
8 + 12 = 20

This works, so the equation is 27 - 15 + 8 = 20.
</think>
<answer> (27 - 15) + 8 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 7, 10, and 43.
We need to reach a total of 46 using these numbers exactly once.
One approach is to see if we can make a combination that works.
43 + 10 = 53 (which is close to 46 but too high)
43 + 7 = 50 (which is still too high)
10 + 7 + 7 = 24 (which is too low)
10 + 43 - 7 = 46
So, the equation that works is 10 + 43 - 7.
</think>
<answer> (10 + 43) - 7 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, we need to create an equation that equals 90 using the numbers 18, 36, 36, and 36. One approach could be to add a number and then subtract another or use other operations to reach 90.
We can start by adding 36 and 36 to get 72. Then we need 18 more to reach 90.
So, we can use the expression: 36 + 36 - 18.
Let's verify: 
36 + 36 = 72
72 - 18 = 54 (This is incorrect, so we need to adjust)
Instead of subtracting, let's try multiplying 18 with 36 and then subtract 36.
18 * 36 - 36 = 648 - 36 = 612 (This is too large)
Let's try another approach: 36 + (36 * 18 / 36) = 36 + 18 = 54 (This is incorrect)
Finally, let's try: 36 + (36 - 18) = 36 + 18 = 54 (This is also incorrect)
Let's try: (36 - 18) * 36 + 36 = 18 * 36 + 36 = 648 + 36 = 90
This works. So, the correct equation is 36 - (18 * (36 / 36)) + 36 = 36 - 18 + 36 = 42 + 36 = 90.
So the correct equation is 36 + (36 - 18) + 36.
</think>
<answer> (36 + (36 - 18)) + 36 </answer>

To create an equation using the numbers 54, 86, and 49 that equals 91, we need to consider all possible combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's explore the options:
1. 86 - 54 = 32 (not 91)
2. 86 - 49 = 37 (not 91)
3. 54 - 49 = 5 (not 91)
4. 86 + 49 = 135 (not 91)
5. 54 + 49 = 103 (not 91)
6. 86 / 49 = 1.7347 (not an integer close to 91)
7. 49 / 54 = 0.9047 (not 91)
8. 54 * 49 = 2646 (not 91)
None of these combinations work directly. Let's try another approach:
Considering a combination might be needed:
54 + (86 - 49) = 54 + 37 = 91
This gives us the result we want.
</think>
<answer> (54 + (86 - 49)) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 54, 86, and 49.
We want to create an equation that equals 91 using each number exactly once.
Let's try combining 86 and 49 first:
86 + 49 = 135
This gives us a number larger than 91. Let's try subtraction:
86 - 49 = 37
Still not 91. 
Now let's try adding 54:
37 + 54 = 91
This gives us the number we want.
So our equation is 86 - 49 + 54 = 91.
</think>
<answer> (86 - 49) + 54 </answer>

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 27, 37, 26, and 60.
We need to create an equation that equals 24 using these numbers exactly once and only the basic arithmetic operations.

One way to approach this is to see if any combination of these numbers can be manipulated to give us 24.
Noticing that 60 - 37 = 23 might be close to 24.
60 - 37 = 23.
Now we need 1 more to get to 24.
We can use 27 - 26 = 1.
So we can form the equation:
(60 - 37) + (27 - 26) = 24.
</think>
<answer> (60 - 37) + (27 - 26) </answer>

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 98, 38, 45, 56.
We need to construct an equation that equals 71 using these numbers exactly once.
Let's try to use subtraction and addition. 
If we take 98 - 38 = 60.
Now we need 11 more to reach 71.
We have 45 and 56, and 56 - 45 = 11.
So the equation will be 98 - 38 + 56 - 45 = 71.

<answer> (98 - 38) + 56 - 45 </answer>

First, let's consider the numbers: 58, 62, and 9. We need to create an equation that equals 13 using these numbers exactly once.
We can try combining these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
One possible approach is to use subtraction and division:
62 - 58 = 4
Now we have 4 and 9 left.
4 + 9 = 13
So, we can form the equation 62 - 58 + 9 = 13.
</think>
<answer> (62 - 58) + 9 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 97, 23, and 9.
We need to form an equation that equals 65 using each number exactly once.
Let's try combinations of addition and subtraction:
97 + 23 = 120 (too high)
97 + 9 = 106 (too high)
97 - 23 = 74 (too high)
23 + 9 = 32 (too low)
Now, let's try multiplication and subtraction:
97 * 9 = 873 (too high)
23 * 9 = 207 (too high)
Now, let's try subtraction and then addition:
97 - 23 = 74 (from above)
74 - 9 = 65
So, the equation is 74 - 9 = 65.
</think>
<answer> (97 - 23) - 9 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's look at the numbers we have: 97, 23, and 9. We need to create an equation that equals 65 using these numbers exactly once.
We can try combining the smaller numbers first. 
23 + 9 = 32
This leaves us with 33 more to reach 65.
Now we look at the remaining number, 97. If we subtract 33 from 97:
97 - 33 = 64
We are one away from 65. We need the number 1 more to get to 65. 
Since 1 is not one of our numbers, we need to think creatively. We already have 32 from 23 + 9. If we subtract 32 from 23, we get:
23 - 32 = -9
Adding this result to our current total of 64:
64 + (-9) = 55
We're still one short of 65. We need 10 more. If we take 9 from 97 and then subtract it from 23, we get:
97 - 9 = 88
23 - 9 = 14
Now, if we subtract 14 from 88:
88 - 14 = 74
We're still far from 65. This approach doesn't seem to work, so let's consider another combination. 
If we look at (97 - 23) and then use the remaining 9:
97 - 23 = 74
74 - 9 = 65
This gives us the result we need. 
</think>
<answer> (97 - 23) - 9 </answer>

First, let's consider the target number we need to reach: 37.
We're given the numbers [19, 82, 67, 3].
Let's try combining these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
82 + 3 = 85 (This is too high, let's try other combinations)
67 - 19 = 48 (This is also too high)
Let's try subtracting smaller numbers from the larger ones:
82 - 67 = 15 (Still not 37)
Now, let's try a different approach:
19 + 3 = 22
Now we need 15 more to reach 37, so we use:
82 - 67 = 15
So we can combine:
19 + 3 + 82 - 67 = 37
</think>
<answer> (19 + 3) + 82 - 67 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's look at the numbers available: 74, 70, 15, and 64.
We need to form an equation that equals 95 using each number exactly once.
Let's try combining the numbers:
74 + 70 = 144 (This is too high)
74 + 64 = 138 (Still too high)
74 + 15 = 89 (Too low)
Now let's consider combinations involving subtraction:
74 - 15 = 59 (This leaves 70 and 64)
Now, let's check if we can make 95 with 59 and 36 (70 - 15 = 55 and adding 10 would give 65 which is close to 64):
70 - 64 = 6 (To get from 59 to 95, we need an additional 36)
Instead, let's try another approach using multiplication and subtraction:
74 - 64 = 10
Now, we need 85 to get to 95:
70 + 15 = 85
So, the equation would be:
(74 - 64) + (70 + 15) = 10 + 85 = 95
</think>
<answer> (74 - 64) + (70 + 15) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, we need to find a way to get close to 70 using the numbers 54, 4, and 20. 
We see that 54 + 20 = 74, which is very close to 70.
Now we need to reduce it by 4 to get exactly 70.
So, we can use 54 + 20 and then subtract 4 from it.
54 + 20 = 74
74 - 4 = 70
</think>
<answer> (54 + 20) - 4 </answer>

First, let's list the numbers we have: 8, 4, and 47.
We need to make 35 using these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- 47 - 8 - 4 = 35 (This works as it uses each number exactly once)
Thus, the equation is 47 - 8 - 4 = 35.
</think>
<answer> (47 - 8) - 4 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's list out the numbers we have: 93, 91, and 56.
We need to create an equation that equals 58 using these numbers exactly once.
Let's try subtracting:
93 - 91 = 2
This doesn't give us 58.
Now let's try subtracting 93 from 91 and then possibly adding or subtracting 56:
91 - 93 = -2
-2 + 56 = 54
This also doesn't give us 58.
Let's try another combination:
91 - 56 = 35
35 - 93 = -58
This gives us -58, which isn't what we want.
Now let's try 93 - 56 first:
93 - 56 = 37
Then we need 21 more to reach 58:
37 + 21 = 58
So we need 21 from combining 91 and 56, but 91 + 56 = 147 which exceeds 21.
Instead, we can look at:
91 - 93 = -2
Then -2 + 56 = 54
93 - (91 + 56) can't work as explained.
Finally, trying:
56 + (93 - 91) 
56 + 2 = 58

<answer> (56 + (93 - 91)) </answer>

First, let's list the numbers we have: 16, 24, 40, and 39.
We need to use these numbers with basic arithmetic operations to get 87.
If we look at the numbers, we can see that 40 + 39 = 79.
Now we need 9 more to reach 87.
Notice that 87 - 79 = 8.
So we need 8 from 16 and 24.
Since 16 - 24 = -8, clearly this isn't helping directly.
Another combination to try is 24 - 16 = 8.
If we use 24 - 16, then we need 79 + 8.
This shows we are almost there. But we have 40 + 39 = 79.
Therefore, our final equation is:
24 - 16 + 40 + 39 = 87.
</think>
<answer> (24 - 16) + 40 + 39 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's look at the numbers we have: 16, 24, 40, and 39. We need to combine these to get 87 using basic arithmetic operations.
16 + 24 = 40
This gives us 40, which is part of our target number 87.
Now we need 47 more to reach 87 (87 - 40 = 47).
Next, let's check if we can form 47 with the remaining numbers 39 and 16.
39 - 16 = 23
We are still 23 short of 47.
39 + 16 = 55
This isn't helping either.
40 + 16 = 56
We are still missing 31 to reach 47.
Then let's try 40 - 16 = 24.
That gives us all the pieces needed.
40 + 24 = 64
And 64 + 23 = 87.
So the equation we need is: 40 + 24 + (39 - 16) = 87.

<answer> (40 + 24) + (39 - 16) </answer>

To create an equation using the numbers 92, 34, and 33 that equals 93, we need to consider different combinations of basic arithmetic operations.
- Start with subtraction: 
  92 - 34 = 58
  58 - 33 = 25
  This doesn't get us to 93.
- Try addition:
  92 + 34 = 126
  This is too large.
- Let's try multiplication and addition/subtraction:
  (92 - 33) + 34 = 58 + 34 = 92
  This is also incorrect.
- Consider a different combination:
  92 - (34 - 33) = 92 - 1 = 91
  Still not 93.
- The key might be in a different arrangement:
  (92 - 34) + 33 = 58 + 33 = 91

First, let's list the numbers we have: 12, 34, and 10.
We need to use these numbers to get 56.
Let's try different combinations:
- 34 + 22: We don't have 22.
- 34 + 12: This gives us 46, which is not 56.
- 34 + 10: This gives us 44, which is not 56.
- 34 + (12 - 10): This gives us 34 + 2 = 36, which is not 56.
- 34 + (12 * 10): This gives us 34 + 120 = 154, which is not 56.
- (34 - 12) + 10: This gives us 22 + 10 = 32, which is not 56.
- 12 + (34 - 10): This gives us 12 + 24 = 36, which is not 56.
- (34 + 10) - 12: This gives us 44 - 12 = 32, which is not 56.
- (34 + 12) - 10: This gives us 46 - 10 = 36, which is not 56.
- (34 + 12) + 10: This gives us 46 + 10 = 56, which is what we are looking for.
So, the correct combination is (34 + 12) + 10.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 44, 76, and 25.
We need to create an equation that equals 95 using these numbers exactly once.
Let's start by looking at the differences and sums we can get:
- 76 - 44 = 32
- 76 + 25 = 101
- 44 + 25 = 69
None of these combinations directly give us 95.
Now, let's try combining numbers and operations.
Let's try: (76 - 25) + 44
76 - 25 = 51
51 + 44 = 95
So the equation is: 76 - 25 + 44 = 95.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 37, 40, and 10.
We need to create an equation using these numbers exactly once to get 13.
Let's try combining 40 and 10 first:
40 - 10 = 30
Now we need to get from 30 to 13, so we can subtract:
30 - 37 = -7
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination:
37 + 10 = 47
47 - 40 = 7
This is close, but not 13. Now let's try:
37 - 10 = 27
27 - 40 = -13
That's not right either. Finally:
40 - 37 = 3
And then:
3 + 10 = 13
So we have our equation: 40 - 37 + 10 = 13

<answer> (40 - 37) + 10 </answer>

First, let's consider the numbers and the target number, which is 99.
We have the numbers: 66, 59, 6, and 20.
Let's try to use addition and subtraction to get closer to 99.
If we add 66 and 59, we get 125.
Now, if we subtract 20 from 125, we get 105.
To get to 99, we need to subtract 6.
Therefore, the equation is: (66 + 59) - 20 - 6 = 99.
We can verify this: 
66 + 59 = 125
125 - 20 = 105
105 - 6 = 99
So the equation is correct.

<answer> (66 + 59) - 20 - 6 </answer>

First, let's list out the numbers we have: 22, 47, and 87.
We need to use these numbers once each to get an equation that equals 62.
Let's try combining different operations:
- 87 - 47 = 40 (This is close but still not 62)
- Adding 22 to this: 40 + 22 = 62 (This gives us the desired result)
So the equation is: 87 - 47 + 22 = 62

First, let's list out the numbers: 69, 31, and 54.
We need to combine these to get 92.
If we look at 69 + 31, we get 100.
However, we need 92, not 100.
Now let's try 69 - 31 and check if we can get 92 with the remaining numbers.
69 - 31 = 38.
If we take 38 + 54, we get 92.
So the equation would be 69 - 31 + 54 = 92.

First, let's list the numbers we have: 54, 72, and 27.
We need to use each number exactly once to get 70.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 72 - 54 = 18 (not 70)
2. 72 - 54 + 27 = 45 (not 70)
3. 72 + 54 - 27 = 99 (not 70)
4. 72 + (54 - 27) = 72 + 27 = 99 (not 70)
5. Let's try another combination: 72 + (54 / 27) = 72 + 2 = 74 (not 70)
6. Finally, 72 - (54 / 27) = 72 - 2 = 70 (this works! )
So, the correct equation is 72 - (54 / 27) = 70.

We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 63.
Let's try different combinations:

- 44 + 24 + 5 = 73 (too high)
- 44 - 5 + 24 = 63 (this looks promising)
So, the equation that works is 44 - 5 + 24.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 5, 44, and 24 that equals 63.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 44 + 24 + 5 = 73 (too high)
2. 44 + 24 - 5 = 63 (this looks promising)
3. 44 + 24 + 5 = 73 (same as above)
4. 44 - 24 + 5 = 25 (too low)
5. 24 + 44 + 5 = 73 (same as above)
6. 24 - 44 + 5 = -5 (too low)
So, the equation 44 + 24 - 5 equals 63.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 67, 56, 84, and 36.
We want to create an equation that equals 59.
67 - 56 = 11
We need to reach 59, which is 11 more than 48. 
84 - 36 = 48
So, we can use 67 - 56 + (84 - 36) = 59.

First, we need to create an equation that equals 58 using the numbers 95, 4, and 41 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
95 - 41 = 54 (too low)
95 - 4 = 91 (too high)
95 - 41 + 4 = 58 (this looks promising)
So the equation that equals 58 is:
95 - 41 + 4 = 58
</think>
<answer> (95 - 41) + 4 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 95, 4, and 41.
We need to create an expression that equals 58 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.
- Trying combinations with subtraction and addition first:
  95 - 41 + 4 = 58
This combination uses each number exactly once and results in 58.

<answer> (95 - 41) + 4 </answer>

We have the numbers 93, 56, and 57 to use once each to reach a total of 94.
Let's try different combinations:
- Using 93 and 57, we get 93 - 57 = 36
- Now we need another number to reach 94, so let's try removing 56: 36 + 56 = 92 (not 94)
- Let's try 93 + 56 = 149, which is too high
- What if we use 93 - (57 + 56)?
  93 - (57 + 56) = 93 - 113 = -20 (not 94)
- Now let's try 57 - 56 + 93:
  57 - 56 + 93 = 1 + 93 = 94
So, we found a combination that works: 57 - 56 + 93 = 94
</think>
<answer> (57 - 56) + 93 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's list the numbers we have: 57, 64, and 39.
We need to create an equation that equals 46 using these numbers exactly once.
We can start by subtracting the smallest number from the largest one to see if we get close to 46:
57 - 39 = 18
Now we need 28 more to reach 46 (46 - 18 = 28).
39 - 18 = 21 (we are not quite there yet).
64 - 39 = 25 (that's closer).
If we take 25 - 18:
25 - 18 = 7 (too small).
64 - 57 = 7 (still too small).
Next, let's try using multiplication or division:
39 * 1 = 39 (1 is already used).
64 / 4 = 16 (4 is already used).
39 * 1 + 64 / 4 = 46.
Wait a minute, we can simplify this further:
39 + (64 / 4) = 39 + 16 = 55 (too large).
It seems my previous simplification was incorrect.
Finally, after trying different combinations:
(64 - 39) + 57 = 25 + 57 = 82 (too large).
Instead, let's try a different approach:
(64 - 57) + 39 = 7 + 39 = 46.
This works!

First, let's list out the numbers we have: 26, 23, and 41.
We need to use these numbers to make 44.
26 + 23 = 49
This is close, but not quite 44.
Let's try another combination:
26 + 41 = 67
This is too high.
Now let's try 23 + 41 - 26:
23 + 41 = 64
64 - 26 = 38
This is not 44 either.
Now let's try 41 - 23 + 26:
41 - 23 = 18
18 + 26 = 44
This works!
So the equation that equals 44 is 41 - 23 + 26.
</think>
<answer> (41 - 23) + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's list the numbers we have: 26, 23, 41.
We need to create an equation that equals 44 using these numbers exactly once and with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try combining the numbers by addition and subtraction:
26 + 23 = 49
Now we need to adjust this result to get 44. We can subtract 5 from 49 to get 44.
So, let's check if we can represent 5 using 41 and 23:
41 - 23 = 18
This doesn't work. Let's try another combination.
Let's try:
26 + 18 = 44
Here, 18 can be obtained from:
41 - 23 = 18
So we have:
26 + (41 - 23) = 44
</think>
<answer> (26 + 41 - 23) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 26, 23, and 41.
We need to use each of these numbers exactly once to get a result of 44.
Let's start by adding 26 and 14 (which is 41 - 27, but 27 is not in our set, so let's just use 41 directly):
26 + 41 = 67
Now we need to get from 67 to 44 using the remaining numbers 23.
If we subtract 23 from 67:
67 - 23 = 44
So we used 26 + 41 and then 41 - 23 = 8, but since 23 is left out, it means we actually used 26 + 41 - 23 = 44.
</think>
<answer> (26 + 41) - 23 </answer>

<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 43, 2, and 44.
We need to form an equation that equals 85 using these numbers exactly once.
Let's try combining 44 and 2:
44 + 2 = 46
This doesn't get us to 85.
Now, let's try multiplying 44 by 2:
44 * 2 = 88
This is close to 85, but we need to reach exactly 85.
We can see that we need to subtract 3 from 88 to get 85.
So, we use 43 as our 3 because 88 - 43 = 45.
But we need to recheck our steps because we used 43 earlier and it's only given once.
If we use 44 * 2 = 88 and then 43 - 3 = 40, this doesn't work.
The only fitting way to achieve 85 is:
44 - 2 = 42, then 42 + 43 = 85.
This uses all numbers exactly once.
So the equation is 44 - 2 + 43 = 85.
</think>
<answer> (44 - 2) + 43 </answer>

First, we need to create an equation that equals 98 using the numbers 19, 95, and 22. 
We can start by looking at the numbers and seeing if any simple operations can combine them.
If we subtract 19 from 95, we get 76. 
Now we need 22 more to reach 98, so we can add 22 to 76.
Therefore, 95 - 19 + 22 = 98.

We need to form an equation using the numbers 34, 39, and 56 that equals 61. 
Let's try combining 39 and 56 first: 
39 + 56 = 95
Now we need to get from 95 to 61, so we can try subtracting 34 from 95:
95 - 34 = 61
This works, and we used each number only once.

We need to use the numbers 52, 16, and 20 to make 48. 
Let's try combining them using basic arithmetic operations.
If we subtract 16 from 52, we get 36.
Then, if we add 20 to 36, we get 56, which is too high.
Let's try another combination: 
If we subtract 20 from 52, we get 32.
Then, if we add 16 to 32, we get 48.
So, the equation would be (52 - 20) + 16 = 48.
</think>
<answer> (52 - 20) + 16 </answer>

==============
<think> 
We need to create an equation using the numbers 52, 16, and 20 that equals 48.
Let's try different combinations:
- 52 - 16 - 20 = 26 (not 48)
- 52 - 16 + 20 = 52 - 16 + 20 = 56 - 16 = 40 (not 48)
- 52 - (16 + 20) = 52 - 36 = 16 (not 48)
- 52 - (20 - 16) = 52 - 4 = 48 (this could work)
- 52 + 16 - 20 = 68 - 20 = 48 (this also works)
Since both combinations give us the result we want, we can choose either. Let's pick the first one that is simpler and more intuitive: 52 - (20 - 16)

First, let's list the numbers we have: 25, 54, and 36.
We need to form an expression that equals 65 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 54 + 36 = 90 (not 65)
- 54 + 25 = 79 (not 65)
- 36 + 25 = 61 (not 65)
- 54 - 36 = 18 (not 65)
- 54 - 25 = 29 (not 65)
- 36 - 25 = 11 (not 65)
- 54 ÷ 36 = 1. 5 (not 65)
- 54 ÷ 25 = 2. 16 (not 65)
- 36 ÷ 25 = 1. 44 (not 65)
- Now let's try different combinations including subtraction and addition:
54 - 36 + 25 = 40 (not 65)
We can also try another approach:
(54 + 25) - 36 = 79 - 36 = 43 (not 65)
Another try:
25 + 36 + 54 = 115 (not 65)
Next try: 
We see that the combination of 54 + 25 gives us a sum of 79, which doesn't help. So we look for another way.
We notice that if we put numbers in a different order, we might get different results.
(54 + 25) - 36 = 79 - 36 = 43 (still not 65)
We are still not there. Let's try a combination that we can think of:
Let's consider:
(54 - 36) + 25 = 18 + 25 = 43 (not 65)
Finally a different way:
Let's try:
54 + (36 - 25) = 54 + 11 = 65
This equals 65.
</think>
<answer> (54 + (36 - 25)) </answer>

<think> 
First, let's list the given numbers: 25, 54, and 36.
We need to create an equation that equals 65 using these numbers and basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try to add and subtract:
- 54 + 36 = 90 (This is too high)
- 54 + 25 = 79 (This is close but needs adjustment)
- 90 - 25 = 65 (This seems correct, but we used 90 which isn't a combination of the given numbers)
Now let's try multiplication and addition:
- 54 * 36 = 1944 (This is far too high)
Let's try subtraction and then addition:
- 54 - 36 = 18
- 18 + 25 = 43 (This is too low)
Finally, let's try addition and then multiplication:
- (54 + 36) * 25 = 90 * 25 = 2250 (This is far too high as well)
The only feasible solution using the given numbers is:
- (54 + 36) - 25 = 65
</think>
<answer> (54 + 36) - 25 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's list out the numbers we have: 25, 54, and 36.
We need to create an equation that equals 65 using each number exactly once.
Let's try combining numbers with basic operations:
- 54 + 36 = 90 (too high)
- 54 + 25 = 79 (not quite 65)
- 36 + 25 = 61 (still not 65)
- 54 - 36 = 18 (disregard for now)
- 54 - 25 = 29 (disregard for now)
- 36 - 25 = 11 (disregard for now)
Now, let's try multiplying or dividing:
- 54 * 25 / 36 = 42.5 (not an integer and not 65)
- 36 * 25 / 54 = 16.67 (not an integer and not 65)
Finally, let's check combinations with addition and subtraction differently:
36 + 25 - 54 = 25 - 54 = -29 (too low)
Thus, combining all these, it seems we need another approach:
36 + 25 + 54 / 3 = 36 + 25 + 18 = 79 (still too high)
Nothing worked until:
54 + 25 - 36 = 79 - 36 = 43 (still too high)
Finally we discover:
54 - 36 + 25 = 18 + 25 = 43 (still too high)
It seems I missed combining:
54 + 25 - 36 = 79 - 36 = 43 (still too high)
The correct solution now reveals:
36 + 54 - 25 = 90 - 25 = 65
This gives the correct result.

Let's start by looking at the numbers we have:
- 70
- 32
- 46

One way to approach this is to see if we can get close to 84. If we subtract 32 from 70, we get:
70 - 32 = 38

Now we need 46 to reach 84. We can add 46 to our result:
38 + 46 = 84

So, the equation is:
(70 - 32) + 46 = 84

- 68 + 50 - 33 is 85 (too high)
- 33 + 50 - 68 is 15 (this looks promising)

First, we need to create an equation that equals 60 using the numbers 27, 15, and 5. 
We can start by looking at the numbers and trying to form a combination that might work:
- Adding the numbers: 27 + 15 + 5 = 47 (not 60)
- Multiplying the numbers: 27 * 15 * 5 = 1875 (too large)
- Trying different combinations with operations:
  - (27 * 5) + 15 = 135 + 15 = 150 (too large)
  - (5 * 15) + 27 = 75 + 27 = 102 (too large)
  - (27 + 15) * 5 = 42 * 5 = 210 (too large)
  - (15 * 5) + 27 = 75 + 27 = 102 (too large)
  - (5 + 15) * 27 = 20 * 27 = 540 (too large)
  - (5 * 27) + 15 = 135 + 15 = 150 (too large)
  - (27 - 15) * 5 = 12 * 5 = 60 (this works)
So the correct equation is (27 - 15) * 5 = 60.

<answer> (27 - 15) * 5 </answer>

<think> 
We need to use the numbers 27, 15, and 5 exactly once to get an equation that equals 60.
Let's consider different combinations of operations:
- 27 + 15 + 5 = 47 (This is close but not 60)
- Using multiplication or division might help.
- 27 * 5 - 15 = 135 - 15 = 120 (Too high)
- 27 * 5 + 15 = 135 + 15 = 150 (Too high)
- 27 + 5 * 15 = 27 + 75 = 102 (Too high)
- Let's try 5 * 15 + 27 = 75 + 27 = 102 (Too high)
- 15 * 5 + 27 = 75 + 27 = 102 (Too high)
- 5 * (27 - 15) = 5 * 12 = 60 (This works)
So, the equation that equals 60 is 5 * (27 - 15).

First, let's list out the numbers we have: 78, 26, and 89.
We need to use these numbers with basic arithmetic operations to get 37.
If we subtract 26 from 78, we get:
78 - 26 = 52
Now we need to reduce 52 to 37, so we try subtracting 89 from 52, but that gives us a negative number, so that's not useful.
Next, let's try another combination: 
If we subtract 89 from 78, we get:
78 - 89 = -11
This is still not giving us 37. 
Let's try: 
Using 89 - 78 = 11 and then adding 26 to it:
11 + 26 = 37
This gives us the desired result of 37.
So, the equation is:
(89 - 78) + 26 = 37
</think>
<answer> (89 - 78) + 26 </answer>

==============
<think> 
We need to create an equation using the numbers 78, 26, and 89 that equals 37.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
Let's try: 
(89 - 78) + 26
First, we calculate 89 - 78 = 11
Then, we add 26 to 11: 11 + 26 = 37
So, the equation is (89 - 78) + 26

First, we need to create an equation that equals 48 using the numbers 40, 47, and 41 exactly once.
Let's try combining these numbers with basic arithmetic operations:
47 - 40 = 7
Now we need 41 and 7 to make 48.
41 - 7 = 34 (This is not 48, so let's try another combination)
47 + 41 - 40 = 47 + 1 = 48
We have successfully created the equation that equals 48.

First, we need to use the numbers 35, 98, 14, and 88 to get 31.
Let's try combining them in different ways:
- 98 - 35 = 63
- 88 - 14 = 74
- 63 + 14 = 77 (This doesn't help as we need 31)
- 88 + 14 = 102 (This also doesn't help)
- 98 + 14 = 112
- 35 + 88 = 123
- 35 + 98 = 133
- 88 - 35 = 53

The closest we got was 63 and 14, but they don't combine nicely to make 31.
However, we need to consider if there could be a combination that uses all the numbers:
- (98 - 88) + (35 - 14) = 10 + 21 = 31

This gives us the target number 31 using all the numbers exactly once.

First, let's list out the numbers we have: 38, 92, and 20.
We need to create an equation that equals 74 using these numbers exactly once.
One approach is to try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
Let's try: 92 - 38 + 20
92 - 38 = 54
54 + 20 = 74
This gives us the desired result of 74.

First, let's consider the numbers we have: 35, 38, and 25.
We need to form an equation that equals 98 using these numbers exactly once.
38 + 25 = 63
Now we need an additional number to reach 98.
Adding 35 to 63 gives us 98.
Therefore, the equation is: 38 + 25 + 35 = 98.

First, we need to create an equation that equals 98 using the numbers 35, 38, and 25. Let's try different combinations of operations.
- Trying multiplication first: 35 * 38 = 1330, which is too high.
- Trying addition and subtraction: 35 + 38 - 25 = 48, still too low.
- Trying multiplication and addition: 35 * 38 + 25 = 1330 + 25 = 1355, too high.
- Trying multiplication and subtraction: 35 * 38 - 25 = 1330 - 25 = 1305, too high.
- Trying a different combination: (38 * 25) - 35 = 950 - 35 = 915, too high.
- Trying another combination: (38 + 25) * 35 = 63 * 35 = 2195, too high.
- Trying a simpler addition and another number: 35 + 38 + 25 = 98, this works!

First, we need to create an equation that equals 68 using the numbers 70, 56, and 54 exactly once.
We can start by looking at the numbers:
- 70 - 54 = 16
- 70 - 56 = 4
- 56 - 54 = 2
None of these directly give us 68.
Now let's try combinations:
70 - 56 + 54 = 70 - 12 = 58 (too low)
56 + 54 - 70 = 110 - 70 = 40 (too high)
If we reverse the order:
56 + 70 - 54 = 126 - 54 = 72 (too high)
Now let's try 56 + (70 - 54) = 56 + 16 = 72 (too high)
The only way left is:
56 + (70 - 54) = 56 + 16 = 72 (too high)
Seems like we need to try another approach, 
70 - (56 - 54) = 70 - 2 = 68
Therefore the equation is 70 - (56 - 54) = 68.
</think>
<answer> (70 - (56 - 54)) </answer>

<think> 
We need to use the numbers 70, 56, and 54 exactly once to get an equation that equals 68.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try subtracting some numbers and adding the rest:
70 - 56 + 54 = 68
Now let's verify:
70 - 56 = 14
14 + 54 = 68
So this equation works.
</think>
<answer> (70 - 56) + 54 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's consider the numbers we have: 68, 24, and 36.
68 is the largest number, so it might work well if we can "adjust" it down to 80.
If we subtract 24 from 68, we get:
68 - 24 = 44
This is closer, but still not 80.
Now, if we add 36 to 44, we get:
44 + 36 = 80
So, we have found our equation: 68 - 24 + 36 = 80
</think>
<answer> (68 - 24) + 36 </answer>

First, we need to use the numbers 10, 38, and 86 to get 58.
We can start by trying different combinations of operations:
- Adding and subtracting: 38 + 10 - 86 = -38 (too low)
- Subtracting and adding: 86 - 38 - 10 = 38 (too high)
- Multiplying and adding: Not possible with just these numbers as it would exceed 58
- Dividing: 86 / 10 = 8.6 (not an integer, therefore not using / between given numbers)
One unused number is 38, so let's try leaving it out and using the others:
38 + (86 - 10) = 38 + 76 = 114 (not 58)
Now, let's try a different approach considering all numbers:
38 + 10 = 48 
48 - 10 = 38
This doesn't work either.
Let's try another trial:
(86 - 38) + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58
This gives us the correct result.

<answer> (86 - 38) + 10 </answer>

We need an equation using the numbers 65, 8, and 73 that equals 64. 
First, let's consider the operations we can use. We can add, subtract, multiply, or divide the numbers.
If we subtract 8 from 65, we get 57. 
Then if we subtract 73 from 57, we get -16, which is not 64.
If we subtract 65 from 73, we get 8.
Then if we subtract 8 from 8, we get 0, which is not 64.
If we divide 65 by 8, we get 8.125.
Then if we subtract 73 from 8.125, we get -64.875, which is not 64.
If we try another combination:
Multiplying 8 by 73 gives 584.
Then if we subtract 584 from 65, we get -519, which is not 64.
If we consider dividing 73 by 8, we get 9.125.
Then if we subtract 9.125 from 65, we get 55.875, which is not 64.
Finally, we need to find a combination that works:
Subtract 65 from 73, then subtract the result from 8:
73 - 65 = 8
8 - 65 = -57
But this doesn't give 64.
I missed the simple combination:
Using the correct operations:
73 - 65 = 8
Then 8 - 8 = 0, and since this is not 64, let's try a different approach:
65 - 73 = -8
Then -8 - 8 = -16 (Not 64)
Finally, the right combination:
73 - (65 - 8) = 73 - 57 = 16
This is still not 64. 
But the combination that works is: 
8 * (73 - 65) = 8 * 8 = 64

First, let's list the numbers we have: 67, 79, 16, 64.
We need to create an equation that equals 66 using each number exactly once.
If we subtract 16 from 67, we get 51.
Now we need 15 more to reach 66 (since 51 + 15 = 66).
We have 79 and 64, and if we subtract 64 from 79, we get 15.
So our equation using the numbers is: 79 - 64 + 67 - 16 = 66.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways with basic arithmetic operations:
- 82 - 20 = 62
- 82 - 28 = 54
- 20 + 28 = 48
None of these directly give us 74.
Now let's try another combination:
- 82 + 20 - 28 = 102 - 28 = 74
This gives us the correct result of 74.

To create an equation that equals 65 using the numbers 73, 8, and 16 exactly once, we need to try different combinations of the arithmetic operations.
We see that 73 - 16 gives us 57. 
Now, we need 8 more to reach 65.
So, 57 + 8 = 65.
Therefore, the equation is 73 - 16 + 8 = 65.

73 - 8 - 16 = 59 (still too high)
73 - 8 + 16 = 81 (still too high)
73 + 8 - 16 = 65 (this works)

First, we need to create an equation that uses the numbers 53, 92, and 29 exactly once to result in 10.
Let's try different combinations:
- 53 - 92 = -37 (not 10)
- 53 - 29 = 24 (not 10)
- 92 - 53 = 39 (not 10)
- 92 - 29 = 63 (not 10)
- 53 + 29 = 82 (not 10)
- 92 + 29 = 121 (not 10)
- 29 + 92/53 = 29 + 1.7358 (not 10)
- 92/53 + 29 = 1.7358 + 29 = 30.7358 (not 10)
- 29 + 92 - 53 = 71 - 53 = 18 (not 10)
Finally, let's try combining operations:
92 - (53 + 29) = 92 - 82 = 10
So the equation is: 92 - (53 + 29) = 10

First, let's list the numbers we have: 34, 16, and 45.
We need to create an equation that equals 95 using these numbers exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- If we use 45 + 34, we get 79, which is not 95.
- If we use 45 - 34, we get 11, which is not 95.
- If we use 45 + 16, we get 61, which is not 95.
- If we use 34 + 16, we get 50, which is not 95.
Now, let's try multiplying and adding/subtracting:
- 45 + 34 - 16 = 63, which is not 95.
- 45 - 16 + 34 = 63, which is not 95.
- 34 + (45 - 16) = 34 + 29 = 63, which is not 95.
Finally, let's try another combination:
- 45 + (34 - 16) = 45 + 18 = 63, which is not 95.
- 34 + (45 - 16) = 34 + 29 = 63, which is not 95.
None of the above worked, so let's try another approach:
- 34 + ((45 + 16) / 2) = 34 + 30.5 = 64.5, which is not 95.
- 34 + 45 - 16 = 63, which is not 95.
- 45 + 16 + 34 = 95, which is correct!
So, the correct equation is 45 + 16 + 34 = 95.

2. 68 + 8 - 24 = 76 - 24 = 52 (This is too low)

5. 68 - (24 - 8) = 68 - 16 = 52 (This is too low)
6. Using multiplication and division didn't seem to help significantly. 
7. Let's try another combination: (68 - 8) + 24 = 60 + 24 = 84 (This is too high)
8. 68 + (24 * 8 / 24) = 68 + 8 = 76 (This is too high)
9. Finally, let's try this: (68 - 24) + 8 = 44 + 8 = 52 (This is too low)
10. There seems to be no immediate combination of the numbers that works directly. However, if we consider rearranging brackets and operations, we get (68 - 24) + 8 = 44 + 8 = 52 (This is still too low)
11. Another try: (68 + 24) - 8 = 92 - 8 = 84 (This is too high)
12. Checking again directly: 68 + (24 / 8) = 68 + 3 = 71. This works!

First, let's consider all the possible combinations using the numbers 97, 64, and 77 with the basic arithmetic operations. We need to make 44.
- 97 - 64 - 77 is not equal to 44.
- 97 - 64 + 77 is 97 - 64 + 77 = 33 + 77 = 110, not 44.
- 97 + 64 - 77 = 161 - 77 = 84, not 44.
- 97 + (64 - 77) = 97 + (-13) = 84, not 44.
- 64 + 77 - 97 = 141 - 97 = 44, this could work.
So, the equation is 64 + 77 - 97 = 44.

97 + 64 = 161
161 - 77 = 84 (This is also too high)
97 + 77 = 174
174 - 64 = 110 (This is too high)
64 + 77 = 141
141 - 97 = 44 (This is what we're looking for)

We need to create an equation using the numbers 1, 37, and 3 that equals 39.
One way to approach this is to consider how we can combine these numbers using arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
1 + 37 + 3 = 41 (too high)
37 + 3 + 1 = 41 (too high too)
37 + (3 - 1) = 39 (this looks promising)

First, let's list out the numbers we have: 83, 23, 99, 74.
We want to form an equation using these numbers exactly once to equal 81.
Let's try combining 99 and 23 first:
99 - 23 = 76
Now we need 7 more to reach 81:
81 - 76 = 5
So we now have 76 and 5. We need to use 83 and 74. 
Notice that 83 - 74 = 9
We need to balance this by subtracting 9 from 76 to get 67, and then subtracting 5 to get 62, which isn't helpful.
Let's try another combination:
74 - 23 = 51
Now we need 27 more to reach 81:
81 - 51 = 30
We need 30 from 83 and 99:
83 - 99 = -16 (doesn't work, negative)
Let's try another approach:
83 + 23 = 106
Now we need -25 to get to 81:
81 - 106 = -25 (negative)
This also doesn't work.
Finally, let's try:
99 + 23 = 122
Now we need -41 to get to 81:
81 - 122 = -41
This also doesn't work.
Since none of these worked, let's try another:
83 - 99 = -16 (negative)
Now we need 107 to get to 81, negative 25:
81 - 107 = -26 (negative)
Also, not working.
The correct approach seems to be finding that:
99 - 23 + 74/83 would give a different result. However, 99 - 23 + 74 - 83 would give 77, which isn't correct.
The right approach finally shows:
74 + 23 - 99 + 83 = 81,
Therefore, 74 + 23 - 99 + 83 equals 81.

Let's try adding numbers:
87 - 42 + 11 works better.
87 - 42 = 45
45 + 11 = 56
This isn't 34. So we need to subtract more:
45 - 11 = 34

This doesn't get us 45.
Let's try using subtraction:
36 - 79 = -43
This also doesn't give us 45.
Now let's try a different combination:
79 - 36 = 43
This is closer, but we need 45.
If we subtract 2 from 43:
43 - 2 = 41
Still not 45.
We can try adding 2 to 43:
43 + 2 = 45
This works! So we used 2, 36, and 79 to get 45.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 10, 77, 48, and 34 that equals 73. 
Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, let's subtract the smallest number from the largest:
77 - 48 = 29
Now we need 44 more to reach 73:
73 - 29 = 44
We have 10 and 34 left, and:
34 - 10 = 24
So we need to adjust:
We can use:
(77 - 48) + (34 - 10) = 29 + 24 = 53
We need 20 more to reach 73:
73 - 53 = 20
20 can be obtained by:
34 + 10 - 77 - 48 = 44 - 77 - 48 + 34 + 10 = 53 - 48 = 5
So the equation works out to:
(77 - 48) + (34 + 10 - 77 - 48) = 29 + (-48) = 73
Therefore, the correct equation should be:
(77 - 48) + (34 + 10 - 77 - 48) = 29 + (-48) = 73
This won't work as is. Let's reassess:
Using the numbers as 48 + 34 - 77 + 10 + some adjustments does not work easily.
Rechecking:
10 + 77 - 48 + 34 - 73 = 51 - 73 = -22
Trying different combinations:
10 + 34 + 77 - 48 = 45 + 29 = 74 (too high)
Trying:
(77 - 48) + (34 + 10) = 29 + 44 = 73
Final Equation:
(77 - 48) + (34 + 10) = 29 + 44 = 73

We need to create an equation using the numbers 64, 5, and 9 that equals 50. 
- First, let's consider the possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- We notice that 64 is a large number, while 5 and 9 are smaller. This suggests that subtraction or division might be useful.
- Trying to divide 64 by one of the other numbers doesn't get us close to 50.
- So, let's try subtracting 9 from 64: 64 - 9 = 55. This is close but too high.
- Now, let's try subtracting 5 from 64: 64 - 5 = 59. This is too high.
- Let's try subtracting 9 and 5 from 64: 64 - 9 - 5 = 50. This gives us exactly 50.

First, we need to create an equation that equals 71 using the numbers 43, 1, and 29 exactly once.
- Let's start by considering if we can get close to 71 using these numbers.
- If we subtract 29 from 43, we get 14 (43 - 29 = 14).
- Now we need 57 more to reach 71 (71 - 14 = 57).
- We can see that 1 * 57 = 57.
- So the equation would be 43 - 29 + (1 * 57).
- However, since 57 isn't one of our numbers, let's try another approach.
- We can try 43 + 29 - 1, which equals 71 (43 + 29 = 72, 72 - 1 = 71).
Therefore, the correct equation is 43 + 29 - 1.

First, let's consider the numbers: 55, 11, 8, 4.
We need to create an equation that equals 98 using these numbers exactly once.
We can see that 55 + 11 = 66, which is close to 98.
We need an additional 32 to reach 98 (98 - 66 = 32).
Now we need to think about how to get 32 from the remaining numbers 8 and 4.
8 + 4 = 12, but we need 32, so this isn't correct.
Let's try multiplication: 8 * 4 = 32, which works.
So, we have 55 + 11 + (8 * 4) = 98.

First, let's list the numbers we have: 49, 64, and 38.
We need to create an equation that equals 23 using each number exactly once.
We can start by considering subtraction:
49 - 38 = 11
11 + 64 is 75, which is too high.
Let's try multiplication:
64 * 38 = 2432 (which is much too high)
Now let's try addition:
49 + 38 = 87 (which is too high)
Finally, let's try a combination:
64 - 49 = 15
15 + 38 = 53 (which is still too high)
It seems we need to rearrange the operations. Let's try:
64 - 38 = 26
26 - 49 = -23 (which is the negative of 23)
Let's try a different combination:
49 - 38 = 11
64 - 11 = 53 (too high)
Now we need to use 49 and 64 in another way:
(64 - 38 = 26)
26 + 11 (but we know 11 = 49 - 38)
Therefore, let's use:
(64 - 38 + 49 - 38) = 49 + 26 - 38 (which equals 27 - 38 = -21, still not correct)
No combination of these works directly, so let's try:
49 + 38 - 64 = 87 - 64 = 23
This gives us:
38 + 49 - 64 = 87 - 64 = 23
So the correct equation is 38 + 49 - 64 = 23.
</think>
<answer> (38 + 49) - 64 </answer>

First, let's look at the numbers we have: 16, 61, and 52.
We need to create an equation that equals 97 using these numbers exactly once.
61 + 52 = 113
Now we need 16 more to reach 97.
So, 113 - 16 = 97
Therefore, the equation is: 61 + 52 - 16

We need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 68, 33, and 5 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
First, let's consider the numbers and their possible combinations:
- 68 - 33 = 35
- 68 + 33 = 101
- 68 * 33 = 2244 (too large)
- 68 / 33 (not an integer, so not useful)
- 33 - 5 = 28
- 33 + 5 = 38
- 5 - 33 is negative (not useful)
- 5 * 33 = 165 (too large)
- 5 * 68 = 340 (too large)
- 68 / 5 = 13. 6 (not an integer, so not useful)
From these, we see that 68 - 33 = 35 is close, but we need 40. We can try adding 5 to 35:
35 + 5 = 40
This gives us the target number 40.
</think>
<answer> (68 - 33) + 5 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, we need to create an equation that equals 43 using the numbers 58, 53, and 68 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
58 + 53 = 111 (This is close but we need a smaller number)
58 - 53 = 5 (Still not 43)
53 - 68 = -15 (Too small)
We need to explore combinations of operations.
58 - 68 = -10
Now adding or subtracting 53 does not fit our target.
Let's try 53 * 68 = 3584 (This is way too big)
53 * 58 = 3, 074 (Still too big)
53 + 58 = 111 (Too big again)
58 * 53 / 68 = (58 * 53) / 68 = 3, 074 / 68 = 45. 38 which is close but not 43.
53 * 58 / 68 = (53 * 58) / 68 = 3, 074 / 68, not what we need.
58 - 53 + 68 = 10 + 68 = 78 (Not 43)
53 + 68 - 58 = 121 - 58 = 63 (Not 43)
Trying combination 53 * 58 / (68 - 53) = (53 * 58) / 15 = 3, 074 / 15, which is not 43 either.
53 + (68 - 58) = 53 + 10 = 63 which is not 43.
Trying 68 - 53 + 58 = 15 + 58 = 73 which is not 43.
Combining 58 + 53 - 68 = 111 - 68 = 43 which works.
</think>

We need to create an equation using the numbers 95, 14, and 2 that equals 67.
First, let's consider the numbers we have:
95, 14, 2
We can try combining these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
If we subtract 14 from 95, we get 81.
81 - 14 = 67
Now we have used 95 and 14. The remaining number is 2.
Since 81 - 14 = 67, no further combination with 2 will change the result.
So the equation is: 81 - 14 = 67
However, we need to use 95, 14, and 2 exactly as they are. The equation 81 - 14 = 67 uses 95 and 14, but we need to incorporate 2.
Let's reevaluate: 
Using (95 - 14) / 2 = 81 / 2 = 40.5, which isn't 67.
Another approach could be: ((95 - 2) - 14) / 1 = 81 / 1 = 81, also doesn't fit.
Considering combinations again: 
The correct equation could be: (95 - 14 - 2) = 81 but we need 67.
So let's use:
(95 - 14 - (2 / 1)) = 81 - 2 = 67
But simplifying: 
The final correct simplified equation must be a combination ideally:
(95 - 2 * 14) = 95 - 28 = 67
This matches our goal of 67.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 17, 31, and 30 that equals 18. Each number can only be used once.
Let's try combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
- If we try 31 - 17 = 14, we're far from 18.
- If we try 31 - 30 = 1, subtracting again doesn't get us closer.
- If we try 31 - 17 + 30 = 44, clearly too high.
- 31 - 17 + 30 doesn't work, let's try other combinations:
- 31 - (30 - 17) = 31 - 7 = 24
- Not quite...
- How about (31 - 30) + 17 = 1 + 17 = 18?
- This looks promising: (31 - 30) + 17 = 18

We need to create an equation using the numbers 17, 31, and 30 that equals 18. Each number can only be used once.
Let's try different combinations:

- 31 - 30 = 1 (This doesn't work)
- 31 + 17 = 48 (This doesn't work)
- 30 + 17 = 47 (This doesn't work)
- 30 + 31 = 61 (This doesn't work)
- Let's try another combination: 31 - (30 - 17) = 31 - 30 + 17 = 1 + 17 = 18 (This works)
So, the equation is 31 - (30 - 17) = 18

We need to use the numbers 18, 7, and 11 with basic arithmetic operations to get 49.
Let's try different combinations:
- If we use multiplication and addition, we could try: (18 * 7) + 11 = 126 + 11 = 137 (too high)
- Using division and subtraction: (18 - 7) * 11 = 11 * 11 = 121 (too high)
- Let's try: 18 + (7 * 11) = 18 + 77 = 95 (too high)
- Now let's try: (18 - 11) * 7 = 7 * 7 = 49 (this works)
So, the correct equation is (18 - 11) * 7 = 49.

First, we need to use the numbers 42, 73, and 59 once each to reach the result of 28.
Let's try combinations:
- 73 - 59 = 14, now we need 14 more to get 28, so 28 - 14 = 14. But we only have 42 left, which can't be divided by 14.
- 73 - 42 = 31, now we need -31 more to get 28, which doesn't work.
- 59 - 42 = 17, now we need -17 more to get 28, which also doesn't work.
- 73 + 42 = 115, which is too large. 
- 59 + 42 = 101, which is also too large.
Since the direct combinations didn't work, let's try a combination that might work:
- 73 - 59 = 14
- 42 - 14 = 28
This works because 73 - 59 = 14 and 42 - 14 = 28.

First, we need to create an equation that equals 15 using the numbers 91, 80, 76, and 80 exactly once.
91 - 80 = 11
This leaves us with 15 - 11 = 4, which we haven't used yet.
We need another 4 using the remaining numbers.
80 - 76 = 4

- 71 - 38 = 33 (too low)
- 94 + 38 = 132 (too high)

One way to approach this is to consider different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 
86 - 31 = 55
Now we need 43 more to reach 98.
So, we can use:
55 + 43 = 98
We used all the numbers 43, 86, and 31 exactly once.

2. 86 + 43 - 31 = 98 (which is what we need)

We need to create an equation using the numbers 33, 34, 41, and 96 that equals 56. Let's try different combinations of operations:
One possible combination could be: 
41 + 34 - 33 = 42
This is close but not 56. 
Now let's try another:
34 + 41 - 33 = 42
Still not 56.
Now let's try:
96 - 41 + 33 = 88
This is too high.
Now let's try:
96 - 41 - 33 = 22
This is still not 56.
Now let's try a different approach:
96 - 41 + 34 - 33 = 56
This matches our target.
So the equation is:
96 - 41 + 34 - 33 = 56

We need to create an equation using the numbers 83, 40, and 49 that equals 74. 
We can start by looking at the numbers and seeing if any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division can give us 74.
If we subtract 49 from 83, we get 34 (83 - 49 = 34).
Then if we add 40 to 34, we get 74 (34 + 40 = 74).
So the equation is 83 - 49 + 40 = 74.

We need to use the numbers 73, 57, and 72 exactly once to get 88.
Let's start by looking at the target number and the numbers we have:
88 - 73 = 15
15 is not one of our numbers.
88 - 57 = 31
31 is not one of our numbers.
88 - 72 = 16
16 is not one of our numbers.
Now let's try different operations:
73 + 57 = 130
This is too high.
72 + 57 = 129
This is also too high.
If we rearrange the operations:
72 + 57 - 73 = 57 + 4 = 61
This is still not 88.
Let's try another combination:
73 + (72 - 57) = 73 + 15 = 88
This gives us the target number 88.
So the equation is: 73 + (72 - 57)
</think>
<answer> (73 + (72 - 57)) </answer>

First, we need to create an equation that equals 88 using the numbers 73, 57, and 72 exactly once.
Let's try combining them:
73 + 57 = 130 (This is too high)
73 + 72 = 145 (Still too high)
72 + 57 = 129 (Again, too high)
Now let's try a subtraction and addition:
73 - 57 + 72 = 88
Here we can see that 73 - 57 equals 16, and adding 72 to 16 gives us 88.
So the equation is: 73 - 57 + 72 = 88

We need to create an equation using the numbers 73, 57, and 72 that equals 88.

If we look at the numbers, we can see that 73 + 15 = 88, but 15 is not available. 
Next, let's try 73 - 57 = 16, which is not 88.
Then, 73 * 1. 411765 is approximately 102. 37, which is not 88.
Now, let's try 73 - 57 + 72:
73 - 57 = 16

We can start by looking at the numbers and trying different combinations:
- 74 - 47 = 27
- 74 + 47 = 121
- 30 + 74 = 104
- 30 + 47 = 77
None of these work for 91.
Let's try:
- 74 + 30 = 104
- 74 - 30 = 44
We need to reach 91. So let's check:
- 74 - (47 - 30) = 74 - 17 = 57
Still not 91. Let's try:
- (74 - 47) + 30 = 27 + 30 = 57
This is also not 91. 
Now let's try:
- (74 + 30) - 47 = 104 - 47 = 57
This also doesn't give us 91.
Finally, let's try:
- (74 - 30) + 47 = 44 + 47 = 91
This works.
So the equation is (74 - 30) + 47 = 91.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 19, 6, and 62 that equals 75. 
First, let's consider the numbers we have:
19 + 62 = 81
This is close to 75, but a bit too high.
If we subtract one of the numbers from this sum:
81 - 6 = 75
This gives us our target result.
Since we used all three numbers exactly once in the expression 81 - 6, we have our equation.

We need to create an equation that equals 75 using the numbers 19, 6, and 62 exactly once.
First, let's consider the largest number, 62, as it can help us reach 75 more easily.
62 + 19 = 81
Now we need to get from 81 to 75, which means we need to subtract 6.
So, the equation becomes: 62 + 19 - 6 = 75

19 + 62 = 81
Now we need to get from 81 to 75. We can do this by subtracting 6:
81 - 6 = 75

- 22 - 8 = 14 (not 31)
- 61 + 8 = 69 (not 31)

- 8 + 22 - 61 = -31 (not 31)
- 8 + 22 + 61 = 91 (too large)
- 61 + 22 - 8 = 75 (too large)
- 22 + 61 - 8 = 75 (too large)
Finally, we realize that 22 + 8 - 61 is close but negative, and adding or subtracting 8 from 61 twice won't give us 31.
The only viable option is: 61 - (22 + 8)
61 - 30 = 31

- Dividing and adding: (31 / 2) + 87 = 92.5 (not an integer)
- Dividing and subtracting: 31 / 2 - 87 = -42.5 (not an integer)
- Another approach: (87 - 31) / 2 = 28

First, we need to create an equation that equals 79 using the numbers 20, 68, 78, and 87 exactly once.
Let's start by looking at the possible combinations of these numbers using arithmetic operations:
- 87 - 78 = 9
- 78 + 20 = 98
- 87 + 20 = 107 (not useful)
- 87 + 68 = 155 (not useful)
- 20 + 68 + 78 = 166 (not useful)

- 20 + 87 + 78 = 185
- 20 + 78 + 68 = 166
- 20 + 68 + 78 = 166
We can see that none of these simple combinations work. Now let's try some more complex combinations:
20 + 78 + 68 - 87 = 166 - 87 = 79
This combination works because it uses each number only once and results in 79.

- 80 - 50 + 53 = 80 - 50 + 53 = 3 + 53 = 56 (too large)
- 80 + 50 - 53 = 130 - 53 = 77 (too large)

We have the numbers 57, 71, and 77 to use in an equation that equals 91. We can try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- If we take 77 - 57 = 20, we need an additional 71 - 20 = 51 to reach 91, but we don't have a number that, when combined with 77 or 57, results in 51 using the given numbers.
- Let's try 77 + 57 - 71: 
  77 + 57 = 134
  134 - 71 = 63
  This doesn't work.
- Let's try 77 + 57 / 71: 
  57 / 71 is approximately 0.8056, which isn't an integer, so this isn't possible.
- Now let's try 77 + 71 - 57:
  77 + 71 = 148
  148 - 57 = 91
  This works.
So, the equation that uses the numbers 57, 71, and 77 to get 91 is 77 + 71 - 57.

2. 61 + 35 = 96, which is close but we need 90, so this isn't quite right.
3. Now let's try 61 + (35 - 6):

<answer> (50 + 27) - 22 </answer>

==============
<think> 
We need to create an equation using the numbers 50, 22, and 27 that equals 55.
Let's try combining these numbers using different operations.
First, let's check if we can use subtraction and addition:
50 - 22 + 27 = 18 + 27 = 45
This doesn't work.
Next, let's try multiplication and addition:
50 * 22 + 27 = 1100 + 27 = 1127
This is too high.
Now, let's try a different combination:
50 + 27 - 22 = 77 - 22 = 55
This works!
So the equation is 50 + 27 - 22 = 55.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 23, 89, and 83 that equals 29. 
First, let's consider the possible combinations of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
- If we try subtraction: 
  89 - 83 = 6 
  89 - 23 = 66 
  83 - 23 = 60 
None of these give us 29.
- If we try addition: 
  23 + 89 = 112
  23 + 83 = 106 
  89 + 83 = 172
None of these give us 29 either.
- If we try multiplication: 
  23 * 89 = 2047
  23 * 83 = 1909
  89 * 83 = 7487
None of these give us 29.
- If we try division: 
  89 / 23 = 3.826 (not an integer)
  83 / 23 = 3.608 (not an integer)
  89 / 83 = 1.072 (not an integer)
None of these are integers and therefore not equal to 29.
- Now, let's try a combination of operations:
  (89 - 83) + 23 = 6 + 23 = 29
This combination works as it equals 29.

<answer> (89 - 83) + 23 </answer>

We need to create an equation using the numbers 89, 37, 98, and 8 that equals 38. We can use basic arithmetic operations.

First, let's look at the sum and difference of the numbers:
- Sum: 89 + 37 + 98 + 8 = 232
- Difference: 98 - 37 = 61

Neither of these directly give us 38, so we need to think of a combination of operations.

Let's try combinations:
- 89 - 37 + 98 + 8:
  89 - 37 = 52
  52 + 98 = 150
  150 + 8 = 158
  This is too high.

- 98 - (89 - 37) + 8:
  89 - 37 = 52
  98 - 52 = 46
  46 + 8 = 54
  This is still too high.

- (98 - 89) + 37 + 8:
  98 - 89 = 9
  9 + 37 = 46
  46 + 8 = 54
  This is still too high.

None of these work directly, so let's try a different approach:
- 89 - 98 + 37 + 8:
  89 - 98 = -9
  -9 + 37 = 28
  28 + 8 = 36
  This is close but not quite there.

- 98 - 89 + 37 + 8:
  98 - 89 = 9
  9 + 37 = 46
  46 + 8 = 54
  This is still too high.

Finally, let's try:
- 98 - 89 + 37 - 8:
  98 - 89 = 9
  9 + 37 = 46
  46 - 8 = 38
  This works.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 54, 13, 50, and 77 that equals 40.
Let's try different combinations of operations:
54 + 13 + 50 + 77 = 194 (too high)
54 + 13 + 50 - 77 = 29 (too low)
54 + 50 + 13 - 77 = 40 (this looks promising)
So, the equation that works is:
54 + 50 + 13 - 77 = 40

We need to form an equation using the numbers 25, 89, and 20 that equals 44. 
Let's try different combinations:
- 89 - 25 - 20 = 44 (This works, but 20 is used twice, which is not allowed)
- 89 - 25 + 20 = 84 (This is too high)
- 25 + 89 - 20 = 94 (This is too high)
- 25 + 20 - 89 = -44 (This is too low)
- 20 + 89 - 25 = 84 (This is too high)
The only combination that uses each number only once and results in 44 is:
89 - 25 - 20 = 44
</think>
<answer> (89 - 25) - 20 </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's list out the numbers we have: 54, 89, and 79.
We need to form an equation using these numbers that equals 44.
Let's try different combinations:
- 89 - 54 - 79 = -104 (too low)
- 89 - 54 + 79 = 114 (too high)
- 89 + 54 - 79 = 64 (too high)
- 89 + 54 + 79 = 221 (too high)
- 54 + 89 - 79 = 64 (too high)
- 54 + 79 - 89 = 44 (this looks promising)
So the equation that works is 54 + 79 - 89 = 44.

We need to use the numbers 2, 10, and 73 exactly once to get 93.
Let's try different combinations of arithmetic operations:
- 73 + 2 + 10 = 85 (This is too low)
- 73 - 2 + 10 = 81 (This is still too low)
- 73 + 10 - 2 = 81 (This is still too low)
- 73 - (10 * 2) = 73 - 20 = 53 (This is too low)
- (73 * 2) - 10 = 146 - 10 = 136 (This is too high)
- (10 * 2) + 73 = 20 + 73 = 93 (This works)
So, the correct equation is (10 * 2) + 73 = 93.

We need to use the numbers 67, 30, 46, and 32 exactly once to get 23.
Let's try different combinations:
- Using 67 - 30 - 46 - 32 doesn't work because it gives -45.
- Using 67 + 30 + 46 + 32 gives 175, which is too high.
- Let's try 67 + 30 - 46 + 32:
  67 + 30 = 97
  97 - 46 = 51
  51 + 32 = 83
  This is still not 23.
- Let's try: 67 - 30 + 46 + 32:
  67 - 30 = 37
  37 + 46 = 83
  83 + 32 = 115
  This is still not 23.
- Let's try: 67 - 30 - 46 + 32:
  67 - 30 = 37
  37 - 46 = -9
  -9 + 32 = 23
  This works!
So, the equation is (67 - 30 - 46) + 32.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 37, 98, and 1 to get 62.
First, let's see if we can use subtraction and addition:
37 + 98 = 135
This is too high.
Then let's try:
98 - 37 = 61
This is very close but not quite 62.
Now let's try using the 1:
98 - 37 + 1 = 62
This equals 62, which is what we want.
So the equation is 98 - 37 + 1 = 62.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 20, 45, and 16 that equals 49. Let's try different combinations of operations:
- First, let's see if we can use all three numbers in some combination.
- We know 45 + 16 = 61, which is too high, so we need to subtract something.
- If we use subtraction, 45 - 16 = 29, and then we need 20 more to reach 49, so 29 + 20 = 49.
- This works! So the equation is 45 - 16 + 20 = 49.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 28, 72, and 55 that equals 11. Each number can only be used once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 72 - 55 - 28 = -6 (too negative)
- 72 - 55 + 28 = 45 (too large)
- 72 + 55 - 28 = 99 (too large)
- 55 - 72 + 28 = 11 (this looks promising)
So, the equation that works is 55 - 72 + 28 = 11.

First, we need to create an equation that equals 17 using the numbers 43, 55, and 81 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
43 + 55 = 98
This is too high, so let's try other combinations:
55 - 43 = 12
This is still not 17.
81 - 55 = 26
This is also too high.
Now, let's try different operations:
(81 - 55) * (43 / 55)
We've already calculated 81 - 55 = 26 and 43 / 55 = 0.7818 (approximately).
26 * 0.7818 = 20.1268 (not 17).
Another combination:
(81 - 55) + (43 / 55)
This is 26 + 0.7818 = 26.7818 (still not 17).
It seems we missed a simple combination:
(55 - 81) + 43 = -16 + 43 = 27. Again, we need 17.
Let's try:
55 - (43 - 81) = 55 - (-38) = 55 + 38 = 93 (too high).
Finally, let's check:
(81 - 55) - 43 = 26 - 43 = -17 (not positive).
We need a positive result:
(55 - 43) + 81 = 12 + 81 = 93 (to high).
(43 + 55) - 81 = 98 - 81 = 17 (this works)

We need to create an equation that equals 52 using the numbers 64, 82, 7, and 63 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try combining numbers to see if we can get close to 52.
If we take 82 - 63 = 19
Now we need an additional 33 to reach 52.
We have 64 and 7 left.
If we do 64 - 7 = 57
Now we need -5 to reach 33.
If we take 19 + (-5) = 14, we are still short.
Let's try another combination: 82 - 63 = 19, and then 64 - 7 + 19 which equals 76.
This is too large, we need to aim for 52.
Trying another way: 64 + 7 = 71
And then 71 - 19 = 52.
So the equation becomes 64 + 7 - (82 - 63).

First, let's list out the numbers we have: 29, 49, 17, 83.
We need an equation that equals 86 using these numbers only once.
Let's try different combinations:
29 + 49 = 78 (This is close, but too low)
29 + 83 = 112 (This is too high)
49 + 17 = 66 (This is also too low)
Now, let's try combinations involving subtraction:
49 - 29 = 20
If we then add 83 - 17:
83 - 17 = 66
Then 66 + 20 = 86
So, the equation is: (83 - 17) + (49 - 29) = 86

We need to create an equation using the numbers 16, 23, and 85 that equals 92. Let's try different combinations of operations:
First, let's try adding and subtracting:
16 + 23 + 85 = 124 (too high)
16 + 23 - 85 = -46 (too low)
16 + (23 - 85) = -46 (same as above)
Now let's try multiplication and addition:
16 * 23 + 85 = 368 + 85 = 453 (too high)
Let's try multiplication and subtraction:
16 * 23 - 85 = 368 - 85 = 281 (too high)
Finally, let's try a combination of addition, subtraction, and multiplication:
85 + 23 - 16 = 92
This gives us the correct result of 92.

First, we need to use the numbers 36, 85, and 13 to make 62.
We'll start by adding the smallest two numbers and see if we get closer to 62:

Now we need an additional number to reach 62. 
Adding 85 to 49:
36 + 13 + 85 = 134
That's too high.
Let's try subtracting instead:
85 - 36 = 49
Now we need to add 13 to 49 to reach 62:
49 + 13 = 62
So, the equation is 85 - 36 + 13 = 62.

2. 90 - 58 = 32 (this also doesn't help)
3. 90 + 58 = 148 (too large)
4. 58 + 88 = 146 (too large)
5. 90 + 58 - 88 = 60 (this looks promising)
6. 90 + (58 - 88) = 60 (let's check this)
90 + (58 - 88) simplifies to 90 + 0 = 90 (doesn't work)
7. (90 + 58) - 88 = 60 (let's check this)
(90 + 58) - 88 simplifies to 148 - 88 = 60 (works)
So, the correct equation is (90 + 58) - 88 = 60.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 44, 33, and 88 that equals 35.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try: 88 - 44 - 33
88 - 44 = 44
44 - 33 = 11
11 does not equal 35.
Next, let's try: 88 - (44 + 33)
88 - 77 = 11
11 does not equal 35.
Now, let's try: 88 - (44 / 33)
88 - 1. 42857 (approximately) doesn't use integers.
Then try: (88 + 44) - 33
88 + 44 = 132
132 - 33 = 99
99 does not equal 35.
Let's try: 88 - 44 + 33
88 - 44 = 44
44 + 33 = 77
77 does not equal 35.
Finally, try: (88 / 44) + 33

  83 - 61 = 22, which is still not 96.
  Let's try multiplication and subtraction:
  67 * 1. 65 (which isn't an integer) doesn't work.
  Let's try combination of addition and subtraction:
  67 + 16 - 61 = 22
  It seems no other combinations are working so far.
  Let's try last order of numbers:
  67 - 61 + 16 = 16 + 16 = 32
  It seems we're not reaching 96.
  Let's check for missing operations:
  67 - 61 + 16 = 32 (incorrect, needs 96)
  Let's check other arithmetic operations:
  67 - (61 + 16) = 67 - 77 = -10
  Let's use division trying another way:

We need to form an equation using the numbers 31, 23, 50, and 81 that equals 39. We can try different combinations of arithmetic operations.
Let's try some possibilities:
- If we use subtraction, 50 - 31 = 19, and we need 20 more to reach 39.
- If we use addition, 31 + 23 = 54, and we need -15 more to reach 39.
- If we use division, 81 / 23 is not a whole number and further combinations don't seem promising.
- Using multiplication could yield something interesting: 31 * 23 = 693, which is far from 39.
Instead, let's try combining numbers with operations:
(81 - 50) + 31 = 31 + 31 = 62 (too high)
(50 - 31) + 23 = 19 + 23 = 42 (still too high)
(81 - 31) - 23 = 50 - 23 = 27 (too low)
(50 + 23) - 31 = 73 - 31 = 42 (still too high)
(50 + 31) - 81 = 81 - 81 = 0 (too low)
Now, let's try another approach:
(50 + 31) - 81 + 23 = 81 - 81 + 23 = 23 + 23 = 46 (still too high)
(50 + 23) - (81 - 31) = 73 - 50 = 23 (still too high)
Finally, one more combination:
(81 - 50) + (31 - 23) = 31 + 8 = 39

We need to create an equation using the numbers 69, 52, and 52 that equals 69. Each number can only be used once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 69 + 52 - 52 = 69 (This works because 69 + 52 = 121, and then subtracting 52 gives 69)
- Other combinations like 52 + 52 + 69 or 69 + 52 / 52 don't work because they either exceed 69 or result in non-integer values.
So, the correct equation is 69 + 52 - 52.

We need to create an equation that uses the numbers 9, 51, and 38 to equal 22.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 51 + 9 + 38 = 98 (too high)
2. 51 + 9 - 38 = 12 (too low)
3. 51 + (38 - 9) = 51 + 29 = 80 (too high)
4. 38 + 9 + 51 = 98 (too high)
5. (51 - 38) + 9 = 13 + 9 = 22 (this works)
So, the equation is (51 - 38) + 9 = 22.

- 32 - 14 + 27 = 45 (too high)
- 32 + 14 - 27 = 19 (this looks promising)

- 16 + 15 - 7 = 24 (Not 97)
- 16 + 7 - 15 = 8 (Not 97)
- 16 - 15 + 7 = 8 (Not 97)
- 15 + 7 + 16 = 38 (Not 97)
- 15 + 7 - 16 = 6 (Not 97)
- 15 - 7 + 16 = 24 (Not 97)
- 16 * 7 - 15 = 82 (Not 97)
- 16 * 7 + 15 = 137 (Not 97)
- 15 * 7 - 16 = 75 (Not 97)
- 15 * 7 + 16 = 141 (Not 97)
- 7 * 15 + 16 = 131 (Not 97)
- 7 * 15 - 16 = 95 (Not 97)
- 7 * 16 - 15 = 97 (This equals 97)

We need an equation that equals 14 using the numbers 59, 63, 17, and 1.
Let's try different combinations:
- 63 - 59 = 4

- 18 + 4 = 22 (this isn't 14)
- Now, let's try: 
  (59 - 63) + 17 + 1
  -5 + 17 + 1 = 12 (still not 14)
- Let's try another:
  59 - (63 - 17) + 1
  59 - 46 + 1 = 14 (this works)

We need to create an equation using the numbers 29, 65, and 34 that equals 60.
First, let's see if we can form a straightforward equation. One possible approach is to use subtraction and addition.
65 - 29 = 36
Then we need 24 more to reach 60.
34 - 24 = 10 (This is not the target)
We need to check other combinations.
34 + 29 = 63 (This is too high)
Now let's try another combination:
65 - 34 = 31
Then we need 29 more to reach 60.
29 = 29
So the equation is:
65 - 34 + 29 = 60

First, we need to create an equation that equals 77 using the numbers 25, 70, 23, and 9 exactly once.
Let's try combining numbers and operations:
70 - 25 = 45
Now we need 32 more to reach 77 (77 - 45 = 32)
We have 9 and 23, and 9 + 23 = 32
So the equation becomes:
70 - 25 + 9 + 23 = 77
We can rearrange it to:
(70 - 25) + (9 + 23) = 77
</think>
<answer> (70 - 25) + (9 + 23) </answer>

==============
<think> 
First, let's list the numbers: 25, 70, 23, 9
We need to create an equation that equals 77 using each number exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
25 + 70 + 23 = 118 (too high)
25 + 70 + 9 = 104 (too high)
25 + 23 + 70 = 118 (too high)
70 + 23 + 9 = 102 (too high)
23 + 9 + 70 = 82 (too high)
Now let's try 70 - 25 + 23 + 9
70 - 25 = 45
45 + 23 = 68
68 + 9 = 77
So, the equation works: 70 - 25 + 23 + 9 = 77

First, we need to create an equation that equals 77 using the numbers 25, 70, 23, and 9 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
One potential combination could be: 
70 - 25 + 9 + 23
70 - 25 = 45
45 + 9 = 54
54 + 23 = 77
So, the equation works out to be: 70 - 25 + 9 + 23 = 77.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 68, 90, and 89 that equals 67. Each number can only be used once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 90 - 68 = 22 (doesn't work)
- 90 - 89 = 1 (doesn't work)
- 90 - 89 + 68 = 71 (doesn't work)
- 68 + 89 = 157 (doesn't work)
- 90 + 89 - 68 = 101 (doesn't work)
- 89 + 90 - 68 = 111 (doesn't work)
Now let's try another approach:
- 90 - 89 = 1
- 90 - 1 = 89
- 89 + 68 = 157 (doesn't work)
Finally, let's try this:
- 90 - 89 = 1
- 90 - 1 = 89
- 89 + 68 = 157 (doesn't work)
After trying multiple combinations, it seems none of them directly work. Let's recheck:
(90 + 89) - 68 = 159 - 68 = 91 (not 67)
However, if we rearrange the operations:
(90 + (89 - 68)) = 90 + 21 = 111 (not 67)
We missed a simpler start:
90 + 89 - 68 = 209 - 102 = 107 (not 67)
Correct equation:
(90 + 89) - 68 = 179 - 102 = 71 (wrong)
The correct equation we need to find:
(89 + 68) - 90 = 157 - 90 = 67

- Next, let's try addition: 49 + 3 + 16 = 68 (which is what we need)
So, the equation that works is: 49 + 3 + 16 = 68

We need to create an equation using the numbers 74, 26, and 92 that equals 44. Each number can only be used once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 92 - 74 = 18
- 92 - 26 = 66
- 74 - 26 = 48
- 92 + 26 = 118
We need to get closer to 44. Let's try:
(92 - 74) + 26 = 18 + 26 = 44
So the equation is 92 - 74 + 26 = 44.

We need to use the numbers 8, 23, and 68 with basic arithmetic operations to get 37.
- First, let's try adding and subtracting the numbers.
- 23 + 68 = 91 (not 37)
- 68 + 23 = 91 (not 37)
- 23 + 8 = 31 (not 37)
- 68 + 8 = 76 (not 37)
- 68 - 23 = 45 (not 37)
- 68 - 8 = 60 (not 37)
- Now, let's try multiplication and division.
- 68 * 8 = 544 (not 37)
- 8 * 23 = 184 (not 37)
- 68 / 8 = 8. 5 (not 37)
- 23 / 8 = 2. 875 (not 37)
We need to rethink the approach. Let's try ordering the numbers differently.
- 23 + 14 = 37 (but 14 is not available)
- 68 - 31 = 37
This seems promising. If we use 68 - 23 = 45 then take 45 - 18 = 27 and finally 27 - 10 = 17 and we don't have 10.
Instead let's use - with numbers directly: 
68 - 23 - 8 = 37

We need to use the numbers 23, 88, 33, and 61 exactly once to make 93.
Let's try different combinations:
- 88 - 33 + 23 + 61 = 117 (too high)
- 61 - 33 + 23 + 88 = 137 (too high)
- 88 + 33 + 23 - 61 = 83 (too low)
- 88 + 33 - 23 + 61 = 159 (too high)
- 88 + 61 - 33 + 23 = 139 (too high)
- 33 + 61 + 23 - 88 = 39 (too low)
- 88 + 23 + 33 - 61 = 83 (too low)
- 88 - 61 + 23 + 33 = 83 (too low)
- 88 + 61 + 23 - 33 = 139 (too high)
- 88 + 33 - 61 + 23 = 83 (too low)
After trying these combinations, none seem to work. But if we ignore the too high and too low examples, we see that 88 + 61 + 23 - 33 = 139 is very close, but we need exactly 93. 
Let's try a different approach: 
88 + 61 - 33 - 23 = 93
88 + 61 - (33 + 23) = 88 + 61 - 56 = 93
</think>

We need to create an equation using the numbers 23, 88, 33, and 61 that equals 93.
Let's try to use the largest number first, 88. 
88 + 33 = 121 (This is too high)
Let's try 88 - 33 = 55
Now we need 38 more to reach 93.
Next, using 61:
61 - 23 = 38
So, the equation is 88 - 33 + 61 - 23 = 93

3. 74 - 33 = 41 (not 44)

5. 74 + 33 = 107 (not 44)
6. 74 + 85 = 159 (not 44)
7. 85 - 74 + 33 = 44 (This looks promising)
So, the equation that works is: 85 - 74 + 33 = 44.

- Then, let's try addition and subtraction: 85 + 33 - 74 = 118 - 74 = 44.
This combination works because 85 + 33 gives 118, and then subtracting 74 from 118 results in 44.

One way to approach this is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Let's try: 38 - 2 + 11
38 - 2 = 36
36 + 11 = 47
So the equation is 38 - 2 + 11 = 47.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 59, 68, 45, and 10 that equals 46. 
Let's try different combinations:
- 68 - 59 = 9
- 9 + 45 = 54
- 54 + 10 = 64 (too high)
- 68 + 59 = 127 (too high)
- 68 + 45 = 113 (too high)
- 68 + 10 = 78 (too high)
- 59 + 45 = 104 (too high)
- 59 + 10 = 69 (too high)
- 68 + (59 - 45) = 72 (too high)
Now, let's try another combination:
- 68 + 59 - 45 = 82 (too high)
- 68 - 59 + 45 = 54 (too high)
- 68 - (59 + 45) = 68 - 104 = -36 (too low)
- (68 + 59) - 45 = 127 - 45 = 82 (too high)
- 10 + 59 + 45 = 114 (too high)
Finally, let's try:
- 68 - 45 - 59 + 10 = 68 - 104 + 10 = -36 (too low)
It seems that none of these combinations work. Let's try another way:
- 68 + (59 - 45) = 68 + 14 = 82 (too high)
I realize we made an error in the previous steps. Let's try 68 - (59 + 10) = 68 - 69 = -1 (too low)
Now we try another potential solution:
- 68 + (59 + 10) - 45 = 68 + 69 - 45 = 137 - 45 = 92 (too high)
Another way:
- 68 - (59 + 10) = 68 - 69 = -1 (too low). 
Here we find:
68 + (59 - 45) + 10 = 68 + 14 + 10 = 92 (too high).
Resulting in:
(59 + 10) - 45 + 68 = 69 - 45 + 68 = 24 + 68 = 92 (too high).
So, the right working combination seems less likely so far. The valid equation we find:
59 - 68 + 45 + 10 = 124 - 68 = 56 - 22 = 46.
This does not work. We might find:
(68 - 59) + 10 + 45 = 9 + 10 + 45 = 64 (too high).
So, 
- 59 - ((68 - 45) + 10) = 59 - 13 = 46.

- 27 + (24 / 70) is not an integer and doesn't work.
We need to use all numbers exactly once and arrive at 19.
Now we try:

70 - 27 = 43 (this is too high)
24 + 70 = 94 (this is too high)
27 - 70 + 24 = -3 (this is too low)
We need to try another combination:

Let's try another:
(70 - 24) = 46 
But we need to get to 19, so combining this with other operations:
(70 - 24) / 27 = 46 / 27 (this is not an integer, so not a valid solution yet)
Trying:

- Let's try multiplication first: 89 * 9 = 801, and then 801 - 7 = 894. This is too high.
- What about subtraction and addition: 89 - 9 + 7 = 87. This is also not 91.
- Let's try 89 + 9 - 7: 89 + 9 equals 98, and then subtracting 7 gives us 91.

We need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 6, 9, and 43 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations of operations:
- 43 - 9 - 6 = 28 (too low)
- 43 - 9 + 6 = 40 (this looks promising)
So, the equation that works is 43 - 9 + 6 = 40.

We need to create an equation that equals 69 using the numbers 33, 42, and 60 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations:
- (60 + 42) + 33 = 102 + 33 = 135 (too high)
- (60 + 33) + 42 = 93 + 42 = 135 (too high)
- (60 - 33) + 42 = 27 + 42 = 69 (this works)
So, the equation that equals 69 is (60 - 33) + 42.

We need to create an equation that equals 64 using the numbers 8, 63, 90, and 83 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
90 - 83 = 7
7 + 63 = 70
70 + 8 = 78
This isn't getting us to 64.
Let's try another combination:
90 - 63 = 27
27 + 83 = 110
This is too large.
Let's try 83 - 63 = 20
20 + 90 = 110
Still too large.
Let's try 90 - 83 = 7
7 + 63 = 70
70 + 8 = 78
None of these work. Let's try:
83 - 63 = 20
20 + 8 = 28
28 + 63 = 91
This is still not 64.
Let's try:
83 - 90 = -7
-7 + 63 = 56
56 + 8 = 64
This works!
So the equation is 83 - 90 + 63 + 8 = 64.

- 81 - 38 + 48 = 43 + 48 = 91 (too high)
- 81 + 38 - 48 = 119 - 48 = 71 (this works)
So, the correct combination is 81 + 38 - 48 = 71.

- 81 - 48 = 33 (not 71)
- 81 + 38 = 119 (not 71)
- 48 + 38 = 86 (not 71)
- 81 + 48 - 38 = 91 (not 71)

- 92 - 88 + 94 = 98 (too high)
- 94 - 88 + 92 = 98 (too high)
- 94 - (92 - 88) = 94 - 4 = 90 (this works)
So, the equation that uses all three numbers once and equals 90 is 94 - (92 - 88).

We need to use the numbers 13, 16, and 61 to create an equation that equals 32.
Let's try different combinations:
- If we add 16 and 13, we get 29, which is not 32.
- If we subtract 13 from 61, we get 48, which is not 32.
- If we subtract 16 from 61, we get 45, which is also not 32.
- Now let's try multiplying 13 and 16: \(13 \times 16 = 208\), which is not 32.
- Let's try another combination: \(61 - 16 - 13\):
  - First, \(61 - 16 = 45\)
  - Then, \(45 - 13 = 32\)
So, the equation that works is \(61 - 16 - 13 = 32\).

We need to create an equation using the numbers 13, 16, and 61 that equals 32. 
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try: 
61 - 16 - 13
61 - 16 = 45
45 - 13 = 32
So, the equation is 61 - 16 - 13 = 32.

- 55 - 23 = 32 (not 45)
- 33 + 55 = 88 (not 45)
- 55 + 23 = 78 (not 45)
- 33 + 23 = 56 (not 45)
- 55 - (33 + 23) = 55 - 56 = -1 (not 45)
It seems none of these combinations work. Let's try another approach:
- 55 + (33 - 23) = 55 + 10 = 65 (not 45)
- 55 + (33 + 23) = 55 + 56 = 111 (not 45)
- (55 + 23) - 33 = 78 - 33 = 45 (this works)
So, the correct equation is (55 + 23) - 33 = 45.

We need to create an equation that equals 45 using the numbers 33, 55, and 23 exactly once.
Let's try combining these numbers with basic operations:
33 + 55 = 88 (This is too high)
88 - 23 = 65 (This is also too high)
Now let's try another combination:
55 - 33 = 22
22 + 23 = 45
So the equation we are looking for is 55 - 33 + 23 = 45.

- 54 - 33 = 21 (not 65)
- 54 + 33 = 87 (not 65)
- 84 + 33 = 117 (not 65)
- 54 + 84 = 138 (not 65)
- 84 + 2 = 86 (not 65)
- 54 + 2 = 56 (not 65)
- 33 + 54 = 87 (not 65)
- 33 + 84 = 117 (not 65)
Now let's try the remaining combinations:
- 2 + 54 = 56 (not 65)
- 2 + 84 = 86 (not 65)
- 2 + 33 = 35 (not 65)
We missed one combination:

- 84 + 2 - 54 = 32 (not 65)
- 84 + 2 - 33 = 53 (not 65)
The correct combination is:
- 84 + 2 + 33 = 119 (not 65)

We need to create an equation that equals 43 using the numbers 81, 38, and 1.
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of the numbers and operations.
Let's try: 81 - 38 + 1
81 - 38 = 43
43 + 1 = 44 (This is close but not quite 43)
Now let's try: 81 - (38 + 1)
81 - 39 = 42 (This is close but still not 43)
Let's try: 81 + 38 - 1
81 + 38 = 119
119 - 1 = 118 (This is incorrect)
Now let's try: (81 - 38) + 1
81 - 38 = 43
43 + 1 = 44 (This is still not 43)
Finally, let's try: 81 - (38 - 1)
81 - 37 = 44 (This is incorrect)
We have exhausted the simple combinations. Let's try this different order: (81 + 1) - 38
81 + 1 = 82
82 - 38 = 44 (This is not 43)
Let's try it this way: 81 + (1 - 38)
This results in: 81 + (-37) = 44 (Invalid as we can't use negative numbers)
We need to re-examine using negative operations. 
Let's try: 81 - (38 * 1)
81 - 38 = 43
Doing this provides the correct result 43.

- 85 + (61 - 2) = 144 (too big)
- (85 - 2) + 61 = 144 (too big)
- 61 + (85 - 2) = 144 (too big)

Let's try different combinations:

- 49 - 4 = 45
None of these work. Let's try:
- 58 + 49 = 107 (too large)
- 58 + 4 = 62 (too large)
- 49 + 4 = 53 (too large)
We need to try different arrangements and use operations:
- 58 - 49 + 4 = 58 - 45 = 13
So, the correct equation is 58 - 49 + 4 = 13.

- 64 - 31 + 43 = 76 (too high)
- 64 + 31 - 43 = 52 (could be the answer)

We need to create an equation that equals 92 using the numbers 67, 42, 22, and 39 exactly once.
Let's try combining them using different operations:
67 + 42 = 109
109 - 17 = 92 (but 17 is not in our set)
67 + 22 + 42 = 131 (too high)
67 - 22 - 42 = 3 (too low)
Let's try another way:
67 + 22 = 89
89 + 39 - 42 = 89 + 17 = 106 (still not 92)
Perhaps we need to try multiplication or division:
39 * 22 = 858 (way too high)
67 * 22 = 1474 (too high)
42 * 22 = 924 (too high)
It seems an intermediate addition and subtraction is needed:
67 + 22 = 89
39 + 42 = 81
89 - 81 = 18 (not right)
Let's try this:
67 + 42 = 109
109 - (39 * 2) = 109 - 78 = 31 (still not right)
67 + 42 = 109
22 * 39 = 858 (too big)
67 + 42 = 109
39 + 42 = 81
109 - 81 = 28 (still not right)
67 + 42 = 109
39 * 2 = 78
109 - 78 = 31 (still not right)
67 + 42 - 39 = 70
70 - 22 = 48 (not right)
67 - 39 = 28
22 + 42 = 64
28 + 64 = 92

So the equation that works is:
67 - 39 + 22 + 42 = 92

We need to create an equation that equals 37 using the numbers 50, 56, 63, and 32 exactly once.
Let's try combining numbers in different ways:
56 - 50 = 6
Now we need 31 more to reach 37.
32 - 50 = -18 (negative, not helpful)
63 - 50 = 13 (also not helping as we need 31 more)
50 + 32 = 82 (too high)
We see that combining 56 and 50 gives us 6, and we need 31 more to get to 37.
37 - 6 = 31
So we need 31 from the remaining number:
32 + 6 + 63 - 50
Start with 32 + 6 = 38
38 + 3 = 41
41 + 3 = 44
44 + 3 = 47
47 + 3 = 50
50 + 3 = 53
53 + 3 = 56
56 + 3 = 59
59 + 3 = 62
62 + 3 = 65
65 + 3 = 68
68 + 3 = 71
71 + 3 = 74
74 + 3 = 77
77 + 3 = 80
80 + 3 = 83
83 + 3 = 86
86 + 3 = 89
89 + 3 = 92
92 + 3 = 95
95 + 3 = 98
98 + 3 = 101
Clearly, there's no direct simple combination working perfectly without exceeding steps. Let’s reassess:
Given 63 - 56 = 7
32 + 7 = 39
39 - 2 = 37 
So we need 2 from subtracting 2 (using positive 32).
(56 - 50) + 63 - 32 = 6 + 63 - 32 = 37

- 69 + (60 - 4) = 69 + 56 = 125 (not 13)
- (69 - 60) + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13 (this works)

73 - 8 - 40 - 11 = 14 (this works)

We need to create an equation that equals 40 using the numbers 42, 12, 4, and 18 exactly once.
Let's try combining numbers and operations:
If we take 18 + 4 = 22
Now we need 18 more to make 40.
So, 42 - 12 = 30
We are still short by 8.
Therefore, 18 - 10 = -2 (but we need positive 8, so let's try another combination)
Let's try 42 - (18 + 12) = 42 - 30 = 12
Then we need 28 more to get to 40.
And 4 + 24 = 28 (but 24 is not in our list).
Let's try 42 - (18 + 4) + 12 = 42 - 22 + 12 = 20 + 12 = 32
We are short by 8.
Trying 42 - (18 + 12) + 4 = 42 - 30 + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16 (still short)
42 - (12 + 4) + 18 = 42 - 16 + 18 = 26 + 18 = 44 (too much)
42 - 18 + (12 + 4) = 24 + 16 = 40
This combination works: 42 - 18 + 12 + 4 = 40

- 29 + 9 - 14 = 24 (too low)
- 29 + 14 - 9 = 34 (too low)
- 9 + 14 + 29 = 52 (too low)
- 29 + 14 + 9 = 52 (too low)
Now let's try the reverse order:
- 29 + 14 + 9 = 52 (too low)
- 9 + 14 + 29 = 52 (too low)
Finally, let's try another combination:
- 29 + 9 * 14 = 29 + 126 = 155 (too high)
- 9 * 14 + 29 = 126 + 29 = 155 (too high)
We don't have the right combination yet. Let's try this with a different operation:
- (29 - 9) * 14 = 20 * 14 = 280 (too high)
- (29 - 14) * 9 = 15 * 9 = 135 (too high)
- (9 - 14) * 29 = -5 * 29 = -145 (too low)
- (9 * 14) - 29 = 126 - 29 = 97 (correct)
So we've found the combination: (9 * 14) - 29 = 97

- 65 + 64 = 129
None of these work by themselves. 
Now let's try combining them with arithmetic operations:

This is not 66.
85 - 32 + 11 = 62
This is not 66 either.
85 - 11 + 32 = 106
This is too high.
Now let's try:
62 + 11 + 32 = 105
This is close but not 66.
We need to try a different combination:
(85 - 32) + 62 = 53 + 62 = 115
Still not 66.
Let's try:
(85 - 62) + 32 + 11 = 23 + 32 + 11 = 66
This gives us 66.

We need to create an equation using the numbers 57, 53, 30, and 41 that equals 75.
Let's try combining some of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.
If we add 57 and 53, we get 110.
If we then subtract 30 from 110, we get 80.
Adding 41 to 80 gives us 121, which is not 75.
Let's try subtracting instead of adding. 
If we subtract 30 from 57, we get 27.
If we then add 53 to 27, we get 80.
Finally, subtracting 41 from 80 gives us 39, which is not 75.
Let's try a different combination: 
If we add 57 and 41, we get 98.
If we then subtract 53 from 98, we get 45.
This is still not 75.
Let's try one more combination: 
If we add 53 and 30, we get 83.
If we then subtract 41 from 83, we get 42.
This is still not 75.
Now let's try: 
If we add 53 and 30, we get 83.
If we then subtract 41 from 57, we get 16.
Adding these doesn't help us either.
Finally, let's do:
(57 - 30) + (53 + 41) = 27 + 94 = 121, which is not 75.
We need to try different combinations. Let's try:
(57 + 41) - (53 - 30) = 98 - 23 = 75
This gives us the correct result of 75.

We need to create an equation that equals 39 using the numbers 67, 95, and 2 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 95 - 67 = 28 (not 39)
2. 95 - 2 = 93 (not 39)
3. 67 - 2 = 65 (not 39)
4. 95 + 2 = 97 (not 39)
5. 67 + 2 = 69 (not 39)
6. 95 + 67 = 162 (not 39)
Now let's try multiplication and division:
7. (95 / 2) + 67 = 47.5 + 67 = 114.5 (not 39)
8. (67 / 2) + 95 = 33.5 + 95 = 128.5 (not 39)
9. 95 * 2 - 67 = 190 - 67 = 123 (not 39)
Finally, we find a combination:
10. 95 - (67 * 2) = 95 - 134 = -39 (not 39)
We need a positive 39, let's recheck:
11. 67 + (95 - 2) = 67 + 93 = 160 (not 39)
After checking all possibilities, we find:
12. 95 - 67 + 2 = 30 + 2 = 32 (not 39)
13. 95 - 2 - 67 = 93 - 67 = 26 (not 39)
14. Final check: (2 * 67) - 95 = 134 - 95 = 39 (This works)

2. We can try using addition and subtraction:
   31 + 3 = 34 (not 13)
   31 + 3 - 21 = 13 (this seems promising)
3. 21 + 31 + 3 = 55 (not 13)

We need to create an equation using the numbers 71, 16, and 13 that equals 68.
Let's try different combinations:
1. 71 - 16 - 13 = 42 (not 68)
2. 71 - 16 + 13 = 68 (this could be the solution)
3. 71 + 16 - 13 = 74 (not 68)
4. 71 + 16 + 13 = 90 (not 68)
The combination 71 - 16 + 13 does indeed equal 68.

We need to create an equation that equals 75 using the numbers 63, 20, 64, and 96 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 96 - 64 - 20 = 12 (not 75)
- 96 - 64 + 20 = 52 (not 75)
- 96 - 63 = 33 (not 75)
- 96 - 63 + 20 = 53 (not 75)
- 64 + 20 + 63 = 147 (not 75)
- 64 + 96 - 63 = 97 (not 75)
- 64 + 96 - 20 = 140 (not 75)
- 63 + 20 + 96 = 179 (not 75)
- 63 + 64 + 20 = 147 (not 75)
Finally, let's try:
64 + 20 + 96 - 63 = 117 (not 75)
63 + 96 + 20 - 64 = 175 (not 75)
- 64 + 63 + 20 - 96 = 49 (not 75)
- 20 + 96 - 64 - 63 = -1 (not 75)
Finally, a correct combination is:
64 + 96 - 63 - 20 = 100 (not 75)
- 64 + 96 + 20 - 63 = 197 (not 75)
Checking again:
64 + 96 + 20 - 63 = 197 (not 75)
Then we try:
64 + 96 + 20 - 63 = 197 (not 75)
Then we have:
64 + 20 + 63 - 96 = 51 (not 75)
We get the right equation:
96 - 64 + 63 + 20 = 115 (not 75)
64 + 96 - 20 - 63:
96 + 64 - 20 - 63 = 97 (neither 75)
Finally, the only combination is indeed:
64 + 20 + 96 - 63 = 117 (this is 75 not factoring out correctly)
Hence, we try:
64 + 96 + 20 - 63 = 117 (not 75)
The final combination is:
64 + 20 + 96 - 63 = 117 (not 75)
But the correct final solution:
(96 + 64) - (63 + 20) = 160 - 83 = 77 (we are near to 75)
Thus:
(96 + 64) - 63 - 20 = 160 - 83 = 77 (we need exactly 75)
96 + 64 - 63 = 97 - 20 = 77 (over 75)
75 check:
96 - 64 - 20 + 63 = 75

  - 18 + 52 + 17 = 87 (This is the same as the first combination)
  - 17 + 52 + 18 = 87 (This is the same as the first combination)
  - 17 + 18 + 52 = 87 (This is the same as the first combination)

- 52 + 18 - 17 = 53 (Not 87)
- 52 - 18 + 17 = 51 (Not 87)
- 18 + 17 + 52 = 87 (This works, but we are using all numbers)
Since we need to use only one operation per number and we found that 52 + 17 + 18 = 87, this is our solution.

- 40 + 31 = 71 (too high)
- 50 - 31 = 19 (too low)
- 31 + 40 = 71 (too high)
- 40 - 31 = 9 (too low)
- 50 - 40 = 10 (too low)
Now let's try using multiplication or division:
- 50 * 1. 18 = 59 (1. 18 not an integer, so not possible with given numbers)
- 40 * 1. 475 = 59 (1. 475 not an integer, so not possible)
- 31 * 1. 9032 = 59 (1. 9032 not an integer)
The only possible way seems to be discovering another way:
31 + 4 x 5 (31 + 20) = 51 (4*5 might not make what we need)
Another possibility, using division:
40 + 31 - 50 should work, since 40 + 31 is 71 then subtracting 50 remains..
50 + 31 - 40 = 41 (too low)
We need 59, so checking:
50 - 40 + 31 will give us 31 which would not be right.
50 + 40 - 31 is our likely final calculation:

We need to create an equation using the numbers 38, 63, and 75 that equals 100.
Let's try different combinations:
- 75 - 63 = 12, then we need 88 more to reach 100, which is not easily achievable with 38.
- 75 + 63 = 138, which is too high.
- Let's try 75 + 38 = 113, then need -13 more, which can't be done with 63.
- Now try 63 + 38 = 101, which is close but too high.
- Let's try different order: 75 - 38 = 37, then need 63 + 37 to be 100, which does not work.
- 63 + 38 = 101, too high.
- Now let's try: 75 + 38 - 63 = 53, which is not right.
- Let's try: 75 + (63 - 38) = 75 + 25 = 100.
This combination works.

55 - 26 = 29 (too low)
91 + 26 = 117 (too high)
91 - 26 = 65 (too low)
55 + 91 - 26 = 120 (too high)
55 + 91 - 7 = 149 (too high)
Now let's try other orders:
55 + 91 + 7 - 26 = 127 - 26 = 101 (too high)
55 + 91 - 7 - 26 = 139 - 26 = 113 (too high)
We need to try another combination:
26 + 7 + 91 - 55 = 33 + 91 - 55 = 124 - 55 = 69
So we have the equation: 26 + 7 + 91 - 55 = 69
</think>
<answer> (26 + 7 + 91) - 55 </answer>

==============
<think> 
We need to form an equation that equals 69 using the numbers 55, 26, 91, and 7 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 91 - 55 = 36
- 36 + 26 = 62 (Not 69)
- Let's try 91 + 26 = 117 (Too high)
- Let's try 91 - 26 = 65
- 65 + 7 = 72 (Too high)
- Let's try 91 - 55 = 36
- 36 + 26 = 62 (Not 69)
- Let's try 91 - 55 - 26 = -7 (Too low)
Now let's try:
- 91 - 55 = 36
- 36 + 26 - 7 = 55 (Not 69)
- Let's try 91 - 55 - 7 = 31 (Too low)
- 91 - 55 + 26 = 62 (Not 69)
Ok, let's try 55 - 26 = 29 (Not enough)
Further combinations leading to 69:
- 91 + 55 = 146 (Too high)
- 91 - 55 + 26 = 62 (Not 69)
Ok, what if we try:
- 91 - 55 - 26 + 7 = 15 (Not 69)
Now, checking another pathway:
- 91 + 55 = 146 (Too high)
- Using 91, 55, 26 - 7 combinations:
- 91 + 55 - 26 = 120 (Too high)
Finally, considering:
- 91 - 55 - 26 + 7:
  91 - 55 = 36
  36 - 26 = 10
  10 + 7 = 17 (Not 69)
Upon reviewing, another possibility appears:
- 91 - 55 = 36
- 36 + (26 - 7) = 36 + 19 = 55 (Not 69)
Just very importantly:
91 - 55 + 26 + 7 is still not arriving to 69! However, the following stands:
The right approach checking subsequent attempts:
91 - 55 + (26 + 7) will evaluate to:
  (26 + 7) = 33
  91 - 55 + 33 = 69
</think>

- 47 + 4 = 51 (not 18)
- 61 + 4 = 65 (too high)
- 47 - 4 = 43 (not 18)
- 61 - 47 + 4 = 8 (not 18)
Now let's try:
- 61 - 47 + 4 = 8 (not 18)
- 47 - (61 - 4) = 47 - 57 = -10 (not 18)
Then:
- 61 + 47 - 4 = 108 - 4 = 104 (too high)
Finally:
- 61 - (47 - 4) = 61 - 43 = 18
This gives us the correct result 18.

We need to create an equation that equals 59 using the numbers 16, 69, 80, and 54 exactly once.
Let's try combining numbers and operations:
- 80 - 69 = 11
- Now we need 48 more to reach 59
- We can form 48 using 54 - 16
So the equation becomes:
(80 - 69) + (54 - 16)
Let's verify:
54 - 16 = 38
Then:
80 - 69 = 11
Adding these together:
11 + 38 = 49 (This is incorrect so let's try another combination)
We need to try other combinations:
- 69 - 54 = 15
- Now we need 44 more to reach 59
- We can form 44 using 80 - 16
So the equation becomes:
(69 - 54) + (80 - 16)
Let's verify:
80 - 16 = 64
Then:
69 - 54 = 15
Adding these together:
15 + 64 = 79 (This is still incorrect)
Let's try one more combination:
- 69 + 54 = 123
- 123 - 80 - 16 = 27 (This is incorrect)
Finally, let's try the original given combination clearly seeing flaws in arithmetic steps above:
16 + 69 - 80 + 54 = 59
So the correct equation is:
16 + 69 - 80 + 54 = 59

- 99 - 49 = 50 (not 33)
- 99 - 17 = 82 (not 33)
- 99 + 17 = 116 (not 33)
- 49 + 17 = 66 (not 33)
- 99 - (49 + 17) = 99 - 66 = 33 (this works)
So, the equation is 99 - (49 + 17) = 33.

We need to create an equation that equals 33 using the numbers 30, 15, and 12 exactly once.
- Let's start with the numbers we have: 30, 15, 12
- We can try different combinations of +, -, *, and / operations.
- Let's try: 30 - 15 + 12
  30 - 15 = 15
  15 + 12 = 27 (This is not 33)
- Let's try: 30 + 15 - 12
  30 + 15 = 45
  45 - 12 = 33 (This is correct)
So, the equation is 30 + 15 - 12.

We need to create an equation that equals 78 using the numbers 56, 67, and 89 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 89 - 67 = 22 (not 78)
- 89 - 56 = 33 (not 78)
- 67 - 56 = 11 (not 78)
- 89 + 56 = 145 (not 78)
- 67 + 56 = 123 (not 78)
- 89 + 67 - 56 = 106 - 56 = 50 (not 78)
- 89 + 56 - 67 = 145 - 67 = 78 (this works)
So, the correct equation is 89 + 56 - 67 = 78.

We need to create an equation that equals 69 using the numbers 75, 59, and 65 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 75 - 59 + 65 = 81 (not 69)
- 75 + 59 - 65 = 69 (this could work)
- 75 + 65 - 59 = 81 (not 69)
- 59 + 65 - 75 = 39 (not 69)
The combination 75 + 59 - 65 equals 69.

We have the numbers 96, 32, and 48 to use in an equation that equals 34.
Let's try different combinations:
- 96 - 32 - 48 = 16 (too low)
- 96 - 32 + 48 = 92 (too high)
- 96 - 48 - 32 = 24 (too high)
- 96 - 48 + 32 = 80 (too high)
- 96 + 32 - 48 = 80 (too high)
- 96 + 32 + 48 = 176 (too high)
Now let's try a combination that's logically fitting:
(96 / 48) + 32 = 2 + 32 = 34
This works since 96 divided by 48 equals 2, and then adding 32 gives 34.
</think>
<answer> (96 / 48) + 32 </answer>

==============
<think> 
We need to create an equation that equals 32 using the numbers 43, 77, and 2 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 77 - 43 = 34 (not 32)
- 77 - 43 + 2 = 36 (not 32)
- 77 + 43 = 120 (too high)
- 43 + 77 + 2 = 122 (too high)
Now let's try the following:
- 77 + 2 - 43 = 36 (not 32)
- 43 + 2 - 77 = -33 (too low)
- 2 * 43 - 77 = 86 - 77 = 9 (too high)
- 2 * 77 - 43 = 154 - 43 = 111 (too high)
We missed one combination:
(77 - 43) + 2 = 34 - 12 (not 32)
So far none of these worked. 
Let's try multiplying and then adding:
2 * (77 - 43) = 2 * 34 = 68 (too high)
Now let's try a negative number:
2 - (43 - 77) = 2 - (-34) = 2 + 34 = 36 (not 32)
Finally we try another approach:
77 - (43 - 2) = 77 - 41 = 36 (not 32)
We need to use another formula:
(77 - 43) + 2 = 34 only
The only way to get it correct is by:
(77 - 43) + 2 = 34
Then multiply by 2 = 68
That is not necessary, trying:
77 - (43 + (2)) = 77 - 45 = 32
</think>
<answer> 77 - (43 + 2) </answer>

- 74 + 52 + 9 - 56 = 85 (too high)
- 74 + 56 - 52 + 9 = 87 (too high)
- 74 + 56 - 9 + 52 = 183 (too high)
- 74 + 56 - 52 + 9 = 87 (repeated calculation, incorrect)
- 74 + 52 - 56 + 9 = 79 (this could work)
So, the correct equation is 74 + 52 - 56 + 9 = 79.

We need to create an equation that equals 34 using the numbers 97, 32, 65, and 30 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
97 - 65 = 32
Now we have 30 left, and we need one more to reach 34.
32 + 30 = 62 (too high)
97 - 32 = 65 (this is one of our numbers)
Let's try something else:
30 + 32 = 62 (too high)
65 - 30 = 35 (too high)
97 - 35 = 62 (too high)
97 - 32 + 30
97 - 32 + 30 = 97 - 52 = 45 (too high)
We need to try:
(97 - 65) + 32 + 30 (already calculated as 32 + 30 = 62)
Instead, try:
97 - 65 + 32 - 30
97 - 65 + 32 - 30 = 32 + 32 - 30 = 64 - 30 = 34
So the equation is:
97 - 65 + 32 - 30 = 34

We need to create an equation that equals 34 using the numbers 97, 32, 65, and 30 exactly once.
Let's try combining the numbers and operations:
97 - 65 = 32
Now we have 32 and 30 left, and we need 0 to reach 34.
32 + 30 = 62, which is too high.
Let's try another combination:
97 - 32 = 65
Now we have 30 left.
30 + 65 = 95, which is also too high.
Let's try 32 + 65 = 97 - 30 = 34.
97 - 65 + 32 - 30 = 34
This works because:
97 - 65 = 32
32 + 32 = 64 (another 32 isn't needed)
64 - 30 = 34

- 69 + 25 + 40 - 69 = 66 (too low)
- 69 - 69 + 40 + 25 = 45 (too low)
Finally,
69 + 25 - 40 + 69 = 123 (too high)
Let's try again with 69 - 69 + 40 + 25 = 45
- 69 - 69 + 40 + 25 = 45 (too low)
- 69 + 25 + 40 - 69 = 66 (too low)
Finally, 69 - 69 + 25 + 40 = 45 (too low)
69 + (69 - 40) + 25 = 125 (too high)
The right answer:
69 + (69 - 25) + 40 = 125 - 65 = 125 - 115 = 10
So:
69 + 69 - 40 + 25 = 125 - 65 = 60

- 94 - 60 + 33 = 67 (too low)
- 94 + 60 - 33 = 121 (too high)
- 94 + 60 + 33 = 187 (too high)
- 9 + 60 + 33 + 94 = 126 (too high)
- 60 + 94 - 33 = 91 (too high)
- 60 + 94 + 33 = 187 (too high)
- 9 + 60 + 33 + 94 / 9 is not straightforward and doesn't fit easily
Then, let's try:
94 - 60 = 34
Now, we need 42 more to reach 76:
34 + 33 + 9 = 76
So the equation works: 
94 - 60 + 33 + 9 = 76

- 60 + 94 - 33 = 121 (too high)
- 94 + 33 + 60 = 187 (too high)
- 60 + 33 - 9 = 82 (too low)
- 60 + 94 - 33 = 61 (too low)
- 94 - 33 + 60 = 121 (too high)
- 94 + 33 - 60 = 67 (too low)
- 9 + 94 + 60 + 33 = 196 (too high)
- 9 + 94 + 60 = 163 (too high)
- 9 + 94 + 33 = 136 (too high)
- 9 + 60 + 33 = 102 (too high)
- 9 + 60 + 94 = 163 (too high)
Finally, we find:
94 - 60 + 33 + 9 = 76

Let's try different combinations:
- 69 - 33 = 36 (not 27)
- 69 - 9 = 60 (not 27)
- 33 + 9 = 42 (not 27)
- 69 + 9 = 78 (not 27)
- 33 + 69 = 102 (not 27)
- 33 + (69 - 9) = 33 + 60 = 93 (not 27)
- 69 + (33 - 9) = 69 + 24 = 93 (not 27)
- 9 + 33 = 42 (not 27)
- 9 + 69 = 78 (not 27)
- 9 + (33 - 69) = 9 - 60 = -51 (not 27)
- (9 * 33) - 69 = 297 - 69 = 228 (not 27)
- (9 * 69) - 33 = 621 - 33 = 588 (not 27)
- (9 * 33) + 69 = 297 + 69 = 366 (not 27)
- (9 * 69) + 33 = 621 + 33 = 654 (not 27)
The only viable combination we haven't tried is 69 - (33 + 9).
69 - (33 + 9) = 69 - 42 = 27

We need to create an equation that equals 77 using the numbers 85, 89, and 81 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 89 - 85 = 4
- 89 - 81 = 8
- 85 - 89 = -4
None of these work. Let's try:
- 89 + 81 - 85 = 85 + 4 = 89 - 85 = 4
This is still not 77. Let's try:
- 89 + 81 - 85 = 170 - 85 = 85
That's close but not right. Let's try another:
- 89 + 85 - 81 = 174 - 81 = 93
Not 77. Let's try:
- 85 + 81 - 89 = 166 - 89 = 77
This actually works!

We need an equation that equals 36 using the numbers 42, 92, and 98 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 98 - 92 = 6, which doesn't help.
- 98 - 42 = 56, which is too high.
- 92 - 42 = 50, which is also too high.
- 98 + 42 = 140, which is too high.
- 92 + 42 = 134, which is also too high.
- Now let's try combining them with subtraction and addition:
  98 - 92 + 42 = 48, which is too high.
  98 + 92 - 42 = 148, which is also too high.
  98 - 92 + 42 = 48 (repeating the combination)
  98 + 42 - 92 = 48 (repeating the combination)
  42 + 98 - 92 = 48 (repeating the combination)
It seems like none of the above direct combinations are working. 
Let's try another way:
98 + 92 - 42 = 148 - 42 = 106 (too high)
92 + 42 - 98 = 124 - 98 = 26 (too low)
Now, a combination that gives 36:
92 - (98 - 42) = 92 - 56 = 36
This works: 92 - 56 = 36

- If we use 84 - 18 = 66, we're left with 66 + 18 = 84, which is not 83.
- If we use 84 - 18 - 18 = 48, we're left with 48 + 0 = 48, which is not 83.
- If we use (84 - 18) - 18 = 54 - 18 = 36, we're left with 36 + 18 = 54, which is not 83.
- If we use 18 + 18 - 18 = 18, we're left with 18 + 84 = 102, which is not 83.
- If we use (84 - 18) + 18 = 66 + 18 = 84, which is not 83.
- If we use (84 + 18) - 18 = 102 - 18 = 84, which is not 83.

- 76 + 10 + 58 + 68 = 212 (too high)
- 76 + 68 + 58 + 10 = 212 (too high)

We need to create an equation that equals 35 using the numbers 84, 91, 53, and 25 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 91 - 84 = 7 (not 35)
- 91 - 53 = 38 (not 35)
- 91 - 25 = 66 (not 35)
- 84 - 53 = 31 (not 35)
- 84 - 25 = 59 (not 35)
- 91 - (84 - 25) = 91 - 59 = 32 (not 35)
- (91 - 84) + 53 = 7 + 53 = 60 (not 35)
- 91 + (84 - 53) = 91 + 31 = 122 (not 35)
- 53 + 25 = 78 (not 35)
- (53 + 25) - 84 = 78 - 84 = -6 (not 35)
- 53 + (91 - 84) = 53 + 7 = 60 (not 35)
- (91 + 53) - 84 = 144 - 84 = 60 (not 35)
- 25 + 53 + 84 - 91 = 158 - 91 = 67 (not 35)
We are not finding the right combination yet. Let's try a new approach:
- 91 + 25 - 84 - 53
  91 + 25 = 116, 116 - 84 = 32, 32 - 53 = -21 (not 35)
There seems to be no immediate combination. Let's try multiplication and subtraction:
- 91 * 25 - 84 - 53
  91 * 25 = 2275, 2275 - 84 = 2191, 2191 - 53 = 2138 (not 35)
Lastly, let's try another break:
- 91 - 84 = 7, 7 + 53 + 25
  7 + 53 + 25 = 85 (not 35)
Finally, let's see:
- 91 - 84 -53 + 25
  91 - 84 = 7, 7 - 53 = -46, -46 + 25 = -21 (not 35)
I've still no suitable solution, so let me try:
- (91 - 25) - (84 - 53)
  91 - 25 = 66, 25 - 31 = -6 (not 35)
So here are some even combinations:
(91 + 25 - 53) - 84
  116 - 84 = 32 (not 35)
And so correct one:
I found the right combination: 
53 + (91 - 84) - 25
  53 + 7 - 25 = 35

7 + 53 = 60 (not 35)
91 - 53 = 38 (not 35)
91 - 25 = 66 (not 35)
Now let's try:
84 - 53 = 31
31 + 25 = 56 (not 35)
Let's try another sequence:
84 - 91 = -7 (not valid as it's negative)
Let's try purely with additions and subtractions:
53 - 25 = 28
91 - 84 = 7
28 + 7 = 35
This works!
So the equation is 53 - 25 + 91 - 84 = 35.

We need to create an equation that equals 67 using the numbers 12, 12, and 67.
One way to approach this is to consider if multiplication and subtraction can be used to reach the target.
If we take 67 - 12 = 55, we are still far from 67.
Let's try another combination: 
(67 - 12) * 12
This simplifies to:
55 * 12
But 55 * 12 is not equal to 67.
We need to check if there's another combination.
Considering the numbers again, let's try:
12 * 12 - 67
This simplifies to:
144 - 67 = 77
This is not 67 either.
But then, let's try a different combination:
67 - (12 * 12 / 12)
Here, we first perform the multiplication and division:
12 * 12 = 144, then 144 / 12 = 12.
So we have:
67 - 12 = 55
This is incorrect.
So, it seems we need to rethink.
After trying the above combinations, it seems the straightforward approach might not yield the result 67. Let's try another approach:
(67 + 12) - 12
This simplifies to:
79 - 12 = 67
This gives us the correct result.

- 69 - 37 + 16 + 25 = 69 - 37 + 16 + 25 = 32 + 16 + 25 = 48 + 25 = 73 (not 65)
- 69 + 37 - 16 - 25 = 69 + 37 - 16 - 25 = 106 - 16 - 25 = 90 - 25 = 65 (this works)

We need a way to get from 48 to 55.
Notice that 55 - 48 = 7
Now we need 7 using the remaining numbers 52 and 45.
52 - 45 = 7

- 39 + 10 - 20 = 39 (too low)
- 39 + 10 + 20 = 69 (too high)
- 39 + (10 * 20) = 239 (too high)

- (20 * 10) + 39 = 200 + 39 = 239 (too high)
- (20 + 10) + 39 = 32 + 39 = 71 (too high)

- (48 - 19) * 5 + 3 = 29 * 5 + 3 = 145 + 3 = 148 (too high)
Let's try another combination:
- (48 - 19) * 5 + 3 = 29 * 5 + 3 = 145 + 3 = 148 (too high)
Finally, let's try:
- (48 - 5) * 3 + 19 = 43 * 3 + 19 = 129 + 19 = 148 (too high)
We need to simplify:
19 + 48 * 3 - 5 = 19 + 144 - 5 = 163 - 5 = 158 (too high)
- 48 * (19 - 3) - 5 = 48 * 16 - 5 = 768 - 5 = 763 (too high)

We need to create an equation that equals 11 using the numbers 86, 54, and 21 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 86 + 54 - 21 = 119 (not 11)
- 86 - 54 + 21 = 53 (not 11)
- 86 - (54 - 21) = 53 (not 11)

After trying various combinations, it seems we need to rethink our approach.
Let’s try 54 + 21 - 86:
54 + 21 - 86 = 75 - 86 = -11 (not 11)
We need to verify other potential combinations:
86 + (54/21) ≈ 100.478 not equal to 11
(86-54)+21 = 33 - not 11
(54-21)+86 = 33+86 = 119 not 11
It seems no single combination results in 11. 
However, by reassessing the simplest equations:
54 + 21 - 86 → 54 + 21 - 86 = -11 (Not close)
(86 - 21) + 54 = 119 - more than 11
Finally, (54 + 21) - 86 → 75 - 86 = -11 (again Not 11)
I now see:
54 + 21 - 86 = -11
Rechecking differently:
Thus we now view one more potential equation:

- 80 + 59 - 17 + 73 = 80 + 59 - 17 + 73 = 139 - 17 = 122 (too high)
- 80 + 59 + 17 - 73 = 80 + 59 + 17 - 73 = 139 + 17 - 73 = 156 - 73 = 83 (too high)

- Try reordering:
59 + 17 + 80 - 73 = 76 - 73 = 3 (too low)
- Final attempt:
59 + 17 + 73 - 80 = 100 - 80 = 20 (too high)
Now, let's try:

- Correct last attempt:
73 + 17 + 59 - 80 = 90 - 80 = 10 (too high)
The only viable combination is:
59 + 17 + 73 - 80 = 109 - 80 = 29 (still too high)
Hmm, I realized a big mistake in the calculation. Let's try:
59 + 17 + 73 - 80 = 109 - 80 = 29 (still too high)
Let's try another approach for correct solution:
(80 + 17) - 59 + 73 = 97 - 59 + 73 = 38 + 73 = 111 (too high)
Review now the only other combination:
73 + 17 + 59 - 80 = 90 - 80 = 10 (too high)
The tricky way require get closer:
Now it's clear that a careful correct solution would be :
(80 + 17) - 59 + 73 = 97 - 59 + 73 = 38 + 73 = 111 (still miss)
make it:
correct now needed:
(80 - 17) - (59 - 73) = 63 + 14 = 77 
It's right.

We need to create an equation that equals 61 using the numbers 1, 10, 73, and 79 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 79 - 73 = 6, not 61
- 79 - 10 = 69, not 61
- 79 - 1 = 78, not 61
- 73 - 10 = 63, not 61
- 73 - 1 = 72, not 61
- 79 + 10 = 89, not 61
- 79 + 1 = 80, not 61
- 73 + 10 = 83, not 61
- 73 + 1 = 74, not 61
- 10 + 73 = 83, not 61
- 10 + 79 = 89, not 61
- 1 + 10 = 11, not 61
- 1 + 73 = 74, not 61
- 1 + 79 = 80, not 61
Now let's try another combination:
10 + 73 - 79 = 10 + 34 = 44, not 61
Finally, let's try:
10 + 73 + 79 - 100 = 10 + 73 + 79 - 100 = 73 + 79 - 100 = 152 - 100 = 52, not 61
Now, another trial:
10 + 73 + 79 - 100 = 10 + 73 + 79 - 100 = 152 - 100 = 52, not 61
Finally:
(79 + 10) - 73 = 89 - 73 = 16, not 61
Still, never mind. Okay, I will try:
(73 + 10) - 79 + 1 = 83 - 79 = 4, not 61
Now a different sectional combination:
(79 + 73) - (10 * 1) = 152 - 10 = 141, not 61
Therefore we need try:
(73 + 10) - (79 - 1) = 83 - 78 = 5, not 61
Why did I code that? Different trial correctly was:
(73 - 10) + 79 = 63 + 79 - 100 = 62, still not 61
Possibly tried again:
(79 - 73) + 10 + 1 = 6 + 10 + 1 = 17, not 61
Lastly, I remember the last combination:
(73 - 10) + 79 - 1 = 63 + 79 - 1 = 142 - 100 = 166, not 61. 
Trying another sequential:
Peripherally:
1 + (79 - 73) * 10 = 1 + 6 * 10 = 1 + 60 = 61

- 29 - (23 - 14) + 1 = 29 - (-1) + 1 = 29 + 1 + 1 = 31, not 19.
Combining another way:
- 29 - 23 + (14 + 1)
This simplifies to 29 - 23 + 15 = 6 + 15 = 21, not 19.
After several trials, incorrect combinations have been explored. Let's consider another:
Using 1 + (29 - 23) + (14 - 1)
This simplifies to 1 + 6 + 13 = 20, not 19.
Finally, let's try:
(29 - 23) + (14 + 1) - 14
This simplifies to (6) + (15) - 14 = 6 + 15 - 14 = 11, but again not 19.
A better simpler test:
(29 - 14) - (23 - 1) = 15 - 22 = -7 not 19.
No successful combination so far.
Final trial:
Let's use alternate combination finally:
(29 - 23 - 1) + 14 = 5 + 14 = 19
This achieves our goal: 
(29 - 23 - 1) + 14 = 19

- 99 + 43 + 1 - 97 = 46 (too high)
- 99 - 43 + 1 + 97 = 154 (too high)
- 99 + 43 + 1 + 97 - 180 = 42
By combining the logic, we see that:
99 + 43 - 97 + 1 - 180 = 42 (valid)
But combining should be correct:
99 + 43 + 1 - (97 + 42) = 99 + 43 + 1 - 142 = 40
Finding right equation 42:
(99 + 43) - (97 - 1) = 142 - 96 = 46 (Wrong)
Finally find the promising one and validate:
(99 - 43) + (97 - 1) = 56 + 96 = 152 (greater)
(99 + 43 + 1/ 97) = 143.1 interpolations will not solve here 
Below proper find one:
1 + (97 - 43) - (99 - 1) = 1 + 54 - 98 = -43
We can find:
1 + 97 - 43 - (99 - 1) =1 + 54 - 98 = -43
99 + 1 - 43 -42 = 77 (Error)
Last found one equation:

We have the numbers 63, 84, and 63 to use in an equation to get 84.
Let's try different combinations:
- 84 - 63 + 63 = 84 (63 + 63 = 126, then 126 - 63 = 63, then 84 - 63 = 21)
- This doesn't work. Let's try something else.
- We notice 84 is the second number, so it might be the result.
- Let's use 84 as it is and combine 63 with 63.
- 84 = 84
This shows we need to adjust the other numbers: 
- We can use 84 as the number and add 0, which uses up one number.
- 63 + 63 = 126 but we don't have usage overlap, thus no fit.
Let's use conditional operations trial:
63 + 84 - 63
This results in; 63 + 84 - 63 = 84.

- 59 + 24 + 39 - 50 = 62 (too low)
- 59 + 24 - 39 + 50 = 124 (too high)
- Trying 59 + (39 - 24 + 50) = 59 + 65 = 124 (too high)
- Now trying (59 + 50) - (39 - 24) = 109 - 15 = 94

- 64 - 31 + 33 - 11 = 55 (not 11)
- 64 - 31 + 11 + 33 = 77 (not 11)
All the above did not give us 11. Let's try rearranging the numbers:
31 + 33 + 64 - 11 = 87 (not 11)
We might have missed something significant. 
Let's try:
(64 - 31) + (33 - 11)  = 33 + 22 = 55 (not 11)
We realize the combination above must be rechecked. We considered each operation only once.
Therefore, combining like mentioned before, we overlook:
(64 - 31) + 33 -  11 = 33 + 22 = 55 (not 11)
Upon rechecking:
(64 - 31) - 33 + 11 = 33 - 33 + 11 = 11

==============
<think> 
We need to create an equation that equals 82 using the numbers 5, 97, 61, and 41 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 97 - 61 - 41 + 5 = 100 - 100 = 0 (doesn't work)
- 97 - 61 + 41 - 5 = 76 - 5 = 71 (doesn't work)
- 97 - 61 - 41 + 5 = -28 (doesn't work)
- 97 - 61 + 41 + 5 = 76 + 5 = 81 (almost works, needs to be 82)
Now let's add 1 more 5 to 81: 
81 + 5 = 86 (still not 82)
We don't have another number left. 
Trying other simple combinations would lead to similar far distances from 82 using given number:

Considering 97 - 61 - 41 + 5 = 10
and 97 - 61 - 41 + 5 + 41 = 97 - 61 = 36 (not enough to reach 82)
So 97 + 61 - 41 + 5 = 114 - 41 = 73 (too high)

Finally, find the right combination:
82 = 97 - 61 + 41 + 5

- 4 + 26 - 12 = 18 (not 23)
- 4 + 26 + 12 = 42 (not 23)
We missed an important possibility:
(26 - 12) + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18 (not 23)
Still missing the right combination, let's consider another approach:
(26 + 12) - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 (not 23)
Trying a different order:
(26 - 12) + 4 = 4 + 12 - 4 = 18 (not 23)
Thinking of using all of them and mixing signs:
(26 - 4 - 12) = 10 (not 23)
Finding the right combination, let's use:
(26 - 4) + (12 / 2) = 26 - 4 + 6 = 22 (not 23)
Back-tracking and checking the options which are:
(26 - 12) * 2 / 4 = 14 /2 = 7 (not 23)
Now, correct approach:
26 - (12 / 4) = 26 - 3 = 23

Let's try different combinations:
- 86 - 83 - 17 + 10 = 0
- 86 - 83 + 17 - 10 = 10

Then we have:
((86 - 17) - 10) * 83 = 524
We're closer, but not quite 24.
Try a different combination:
(86 - 17) + (83 - 10) = 83 + 73 = 156
We are still not there!
Try this one:
(86 + 17) - (10 * 83 / 83) = 103 - 10 = 93
That's far from 24. 
Alright, let's try one last approach:
86 - 17 + 10 + 83 = 182
Nope!
Back to the first!
Try finally different permutation:
(83 + 86 - 10) / 17 = 169 / 17 = 9. 96
No way.
Smaller combinations:
86 + (83 - 10) = 159
(86 + 83) - 10 = 159
Smaller solutions are not.
Actually, looking differently...
Really starts to feel right now:
17 * (86 / 83) => complex better
Finally almost,
83/86 + 17 -10 
Recheck it => try few more sequences again.
No - not right!
Ok like earlier last time:
Checking only slight mis-order:
Try 17 * (86 / 83 - 1) = qualifying.
Important correction simplising:
Let's try: (86 + 10) - 17 * 83 / 83
Rechecking basic simple:

We need to create an equation that equals 23 using the numbers 69, 56, and 36 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 69 - 56 - 36 = -23 (too low)
- 69 - 56 + 36 = 53 (too high)
- 69 + 56 - 36 = 89 (too high)

- 69 + (56 - 36) = 89 (too high)
- (69 + 56) - 36 = 91 (too high)
- 56 + (69 - 36) = 89 (too high)
We realize the previous combinations do not give us 23. Now let's try:
- 69 - [(56 - 36) / 2] = 69 - 10 / 2 = 69 - 5 = 64 (too high)
- Testing combinations again: Finally finding  (69 56 36 ):  
  56 + (69 - 36) = 56 + 33 = 89 (incorrect)
Finally, we try 69 + 56 - 36 = 89 (no)
Corrected manually, revisiting fresh:
Hence finally, 56 + 36 - 69 = 0, i.e also gave incalculations. No possible solution using only one equation upto now hence a leaf branch attempt again.
Finally, let's accept a smaller settle above mixed calculations were. Hence picking now minor physically live solving from stand-alone answer of ' 56 - 36 + 69 = 89 ; confusing recalculation need clarifying.

- 93 + 8 - 43 + 53 = 93 + 8 - 43 + 53 = 101 - 43 + 53 = 58 + 53 = 111 (not 91)
- 93 - 8 + 43 + 53 = 93 - 8 + 43 + 53 = 85 + 96 = 181 (not 91)
- 8 + 43 + 53 - 93 = 8 + 43 + 53 - 93 = 101 - 93 = 8 (not 91)
- 93 + 8 - 43 - 53 = 93 + 8 - 43 - 53 = 101 - 96 = 5 (not 91)
Finally, we try:
- 93 + 53 + 8 - 43 = 93 + 53 + 8 - 43 = 146 - 43 = 103 (not 91)
Seems like something is missing in combinations.

We need to create an equation that equals 37 using the numbers 8, 25, and 96 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 96 - 25 - 8 = 63 (too high)
- 96 - 25 + 8 = 79 (too high)
- 96 + 25 - 8 = 113 (too high)

Now let's try another way:
- 96 + (25 - 8) = 113 (too high)
- 25 + 96 - 8 = 113 (too high)
We already exhausted some logical arithmetic, but let's consider some other logic:
- (96 / (8 - 25)) is invalid due by division by zero.
- Try cross-operations: (96 / 8) + 25 can be tested as feasible:
  96 / 8 = 12, 12 + 25 = 37.

This combination works because:
66 + 59 = 125
125 - 34 = 91
91 - 28 = 63
But we need 69, not 63. Let's check another possibility:
- 66 + 59 - 28 - 34 = 69
This combination works because:
66 + 59 = 125
125 - 28 = 97
97 - 34 = 63
This is also not correct. Let's try one more time:
- 66 - 59 + 34 + 28 = 69
This combination works because:
66 - 59 = 7
7 + 34 = 41
41 + 28 = 69
This is correct. So, the equation is 66 - 59 + 34 + 28 = 69.

We need to create an equation that equals 73 using the numbers 25, 17, and 31. 
One way to approach this is to try different combinations of operations.
Let's try: 
31 + 25 - 17
31 + 25 - 17 = 46
That's not 73.
Let's try another combination:
25 + 31 - 17
25 + 31 - 17 = 39
That's also not 73.
Let's try: 
25 * 31 - 17
25 * 31 - 17 = 775 - 17 = 758
That’s too high.
Now we try:
31 - 17 + 25 
31 - 17 + 25 = 14 + 25 = 39
Finally, we try:
(31 + 25) / 17
It's not giving as the required results.
Lastly, we try:
(31 - 25) + 17
31 - 25 + 17 = 6 + 17 = 23
Realize that the attempt produced better results would tricky back through the error and setups workings as well.
(31 - 25) + 17=(6 + 17) = 23 is still seems previous error.
Let's revise:
31 + (25 + 17)
31 + (25 + 17) = 31 + 42 = 73

- 49 + 56 + 84 = 189 (too large)
After trying these combinations, I realize each combination missed the correct values.
Lastly,
- 56 * (84 / 49)
= 56 * (1.714285714)
= 96 (considering simplification)
Considering fractions might need reconsideration.

We need to create an equation that equals 78 using the numbers 54, 13, 77, and 42 exactly once.
Let's try different combinations:
- 77 + 54 - 13 - 42 = 105 - 55 = 50 (not 78)
- 77 + 42 - 54 - 13 = 119 - 67 = 52 (not 78)
- 77 + 54 - 42 - 13 = 131 - 55 = 76 (not 78)
- 77 + 54 - 42 + 13 = 191 - 75 = 116 (not 78)
- 77 + 54 + 13 - 42 = 145 - 42 = 103 (not 78)
- 77 - 54 + 13 + 42 = 23 + 55 = 78 (this works)
So, 77 - 54 + 13 + 42 equals 78.
